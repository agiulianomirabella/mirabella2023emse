        ""description"": ""Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, has died, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nShe became Queen in 1952 at the age of 25 and spent 70 years on the throne. She had pledged to serve her people, which she fulfilled through a combination of skill and a sense of duty.\n\nIt was during the Second World War that the then Princess Elizabeth gave her first address to the nation, saying that when peace returned, \""it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place\"".\n\nShe joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the first female in the Royal Family to become a full-time member of the armed forces.\n\nOn victory day in Europe, she appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill, and later danced on the streets with the crowds, pulling an officer's cap over her eyes so nobody recognised her.\n\nIn 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, the wedding helping to lift the post-war gloom of austerity and forging a union that lasted 73 years.\n\nNews of the death of her father, George VI, in 1952 reached Elizabeth while she was on safari in Kenya. The following year her coronation was held, with hundreds of thousands of people lining the route to Westminster Abbey and more than 20 million watching on television.\n\nHer reign began with a six-month tour of the Commonwealth. She believed the institution should move away from empire and become more about friendship and equal rights between nations.\n\nShe was delighted when her eldest son, Prince Charles, announced his engagement to Lady Diana Spencer, with their wedding in 1981 becoming a global television event.\n\nBut the breakdown of the relationship, and that of Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, wounded the institution of monarchy, and when Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997, the Queen faced criticism for remaining at Balmoral with her bereaved grandchildren. When she returned to London, on the eve of Diana's funeral, the Queen gave a personal expression of grief.\n\nIn 2002, she lost her only sibling, Princess Margaret, and then just seven weeks later, her mother.\n\nGolden Jubilee celebrations, marking 50 years on the throne, were held that year. Support for the monarchy had risen, reaching an all-time high when she became the unexpected star of the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBut there were more difficult times ahead. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle said a lack of support from the Royal Family contributed to the decision the couple made to step away from royal duties.\n\nAnd Prince Andrew was removed from his public roles as the scandal that had started with his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein grew.  \n\nThe Covid pandemic was the biggest global crisis of her long reign. In a rare speech during the first lockdown in 2020, the Queen made it clear that she understood the grief and hardship people were facing, invoking Vera Lynn's wartime classic, We'll Meet Again.\n\nA year later, she had to deal with the death at 99 of Prince Philip, her husband of seven decades and \""rock\"".\n\nThe Platinum Jubilee in 2022 marked 70 years on the throne, and despite mobility issues she continued with public duties. \n\nCathy Newman looks back at the life of Queen Elizabeth and how Britain transformed during her reign."",

        ""title"": ""Queen Elizabeth II and Britain's leaders - Britain's longest reigning monarch | DW Documentary"",
        ""description"": ""In memoriam Queen Elizabeth II\n\n[This documentary was originally released in April 2022]\n\nOn February 6, 2022, Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her 70th anniversary on the throne. No other head of state has been in power for so long. This film analyzes the fascinating relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and her prime ministers.\n\nWinston Churchill was in love with his young queen. The relationship with Margaret Thatcher was difficult.

No other head of state has been in power for so long. This film analyzes the fascinating relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and her prime ministers.\n\nWinston Churchill was in love with his young queen. The relationship with Margaret Thatcher was difficult. Then there’s Brexiteer Boris Johnson - this film illuminates the very different relationships Queen Elizabeth has had with the many prime ministers who have served during her long reign. \n\nFilmmakers Katharina Wolff and Larissa Klinker examine Queen Elizabeth II’s role as the symbol of a centuries-old power structure in the United Kingdom.

        ""description"": ""Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, has died, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nShe became Queen in 1952 at the age of 25 and spent 70 years on the throne. She had pledged to serve her people, which she fulfilled through a combination of skill and a sense of duty.\n\nIt was during the Second World War that the then Princess Elizabeth gave her first address to the nation, saying that when peace returned, \""it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place\"".\n\nShe joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the first female in the Royal Family to become a full-time member of the armed forces.\n\nOn victory day in Europe, she appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill, and later danced on the streets with the crowds, pulling an officer's cap over her eyes so nobody recognised her.\n\nIn 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, the wedding helping to lift the post-war gloom of austerity and forging a union that lasted 73 years.\n\nNews of the death of her father, George VI, in 1952 reached Elizabeth while she was on safari in Kenya. The following year her coronation was held, with hundreds of thousands of people lining the route to Westminster Abbey and more than 20 million watching on television.\n\nHer reign began with a six-month tour of the Commonwealth. She believed the institution should move away from empire and become more about friendship and equal rights between nations.\n\nShe was delighted when her eldest son, Prince Charles, announced his engagement to Lady Diana Spencer, with their wedding in 1981 becoming a global television event.\n\nBut the breakdown of the relationship, and that of Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, wounded the institution of monarchy, and when Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997, the Queen faced criticism for remaining at Balmoral with her bereaved grandchildren. When she returned to London, on the eve of Diana's funeral, the Queen gave a personal expression of grief.\n\nIn 2002, she lost her only sibling, Princess Margaret, and then just seven weeks later, her mother.\n\nGolden Jubilee celebrations, marking 50 years on the throne, were held that year. Support for the monarchy had risen, reaching an all-time high when she became the unexpected star of the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBut there were more difficult times ahead. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle said a lack of support from the Royal Family contributed to the decision the couple made to step away from royal duties.\n\nAnd Prince Andrew was removed from his public roles as the scandal that had started with his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein grew.  \n\nThe Covid pandemic was the biggest global crisis of her long reign. In a rare speech during the first lockdown in 2020, the Queen made it clear that she understood the grief and hardship people were facing, invoking Vera Lynn's wartime classic, We'll Meet Again.\n\nA year later, she had to deal with the death at 99 of Prince Philip, her husband of seven decades and \""rock\"".\n\nThe Platinum Jubilee in 2022 marked 70 years on the throne, and despite mobility issues she continued with public duties. \n\nCathy Newman looks back at the life of Queen Elizabeth and how Britain transformed during her reign."",

        ""description"": ""In memoriam Queen Elizabeth II\n\n[This documentary was originally released in April 2022]\n\nOn February 6, 2022, Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her 70th anniversary on the throne. No other head of state has been in power for so long. This film analyzes the fascinating relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and her prime ministers.\n\nWinston Churchill was in love with his young queen. The relationship with Margaret Thatcher was difficult. Then there’s Brexiteer Boris Johnson - this film illuminates the very different relationships Queen Elizabeth has had with the many prime ministers who have served during her long reign. \n\nFilmmakers Katharina Wolff and Larissa Klinker examine Queen Elizabeth II’s role as the symbol of a centuries-old power structure in the United Kingdom. Although the British monarch has no direct political power, the prime minister travels from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace every week for a private audience. \n\nIn this film, personal secretaries, political experts and Buckingham Palace insiders reveal what is discussed at these private meetings and how much impact personalities have on the relationship between royalty and the government.\n\nUsing archival footage and personal accounts, the film shows how the queen accompanied her prime ministers through their time in office. On September 6, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Liz Truss as the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #QueenElizabeth \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

        ""title"": ""Queen Elizabeth II dies aged 96"",
        ""description"": ""Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, has died, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nShe became Queen in 1952 at the age of 25 and spent 70 years on the throne. She had pledged to serve her people, which she fulfilled through a combination of skill and a sense of duty.\n\nIt was during the Second World War that the then Princess Elizabeth gave her first address to the nation, saying that when peace returned, \""it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place\"".\n\nShe joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the first female in the Royal Family to become a full-time member of the armed forces.\n\nOn victory day in Europe, she appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill, and later danced on the streets with the crowds, pulling an officer's cap over her eyes so nobody recognised her.\n\nIn 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, the wedding helping to lift the post-war gloom of austerity and forging a union that lasted 73 years.\n\nNews of the death of her father, George VI, in 1952 reached Elizabeth while she was on safari in Kenya. The following year her coronation was held, with hundreds of thousands of people lining the route to Westminster Abbey and more than 20 million watching on television.\n\nHer reign began with a six-month tour of the Commonwealth. She believed the institution should move away from empire and become more about friendship and equal rights between nations.\n\nShe was delighted when her eldest son, Prince Charles, announced his engagement to Lady Diana Spencer, with their wedding in 1981 becoming a global television event.\n\nBut the breakdown of the relationship, and that of Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, wounded the institution of monarchy, and when Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997, the Queen faced criticism for remaining at Balmoral with her bereaved grandchildren. When she returned to London, on the eve of Diana's funeral, the Queen gave a personal expression of grief.\n\nIn 2002, she lost her only sibling, Princess Margaret, and then just seven weeks later, her mother.\n\nGolden Jubilee celebrations, marking 50 years on the throne, were held that year. Support for the monarchy had risen, reaching an all-time high when she became the unexpected star of the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBut there were more difficult times ahead. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle said a lack of support from the Royal Family contributed to the decision the couple made to step away from royal duties.\n\nAnd Prince Andrew was removed from his public roles as the scandal that had started with his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein grew.  \n\nThe Covid pandemic was the biggest global crisis of her long reign. In a rare speech during the first lockdown in 2020, the Queen made it clear that she understood the grief and hardship people were facing, invoking Vera Lynn's wartime classic, We'll Meet Again.\n\nA year later, she had to deal with the death at 99 of Prince Philip, her husband of seven decades and \""rock\"".\n\nThe Platinum Jubilee in 2022 marked 70 years on the throne, and despite mobility issues she continued with public duties. \n\nCathy Newman looks back at the life of Queen Elizabeth and how Britain transformed during her reign."",

        ""title"": ""Queen Elizabeth II and Britain's leaders - Britain's longest reigning monarch | DW Documentary"",
        ""description"": ""In memoriam Queen Elizabeth II\n\n[This documentary was originally released in April 2022]\n\nOn February 6, 2022, Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her 70th anniversary on the throne. No other head of state has been in power for so long. This film analyzes the fascinating relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and her prime ministers.\n\nWinston Churchill was in love with his young queen. The relationship with Margaret Thatcher was difficult. Then there’s Brexiteer Boris Johnson - this film illuminates the very different relationships Queen Elizabeth has had with the many prime ministers who have served during her long reign. \n\nFilmmakers Katharina Wolff and Larissa Klinker examine Queen Elizabeth II’s role as the symbol of a centuries-old power structure in the United Kingdom. Although the British monarch has no direct political power, the prime minister travels from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace every week for a private audience. \n\nIn this film, personal secretaries, political experts and Buckingham Palace insiders reveal what is discussed at these private meetings and how much impact personalities have on the relationship between royalty and the government.\n\nUsing archival footage and personal accounts, the film shows how the queen accompanied her prime ministers through their time in office. On September 6, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Liz Truss as the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #QueenElizabeth \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

          ""description"": ""In memoriam Queen Elizabeth II\n\n[This documentary was originally released in April 2022]\n\nOn February 6, 2022, Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her 70th anniversary on the throne. No other head of state has been in power for so long. This film analyzes the fascinating relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and her prime ministers.\n\nWinston Churchill was in love with his young queen. The relationship with Margaret Thatcher was difficult. Then there’s Brexiteer Boris Johnson - this film illuminates the very different relationships Queen Elizabeth has had with the many prime ministers who have served during her long reign. \n\nFilmmakers Katharina Wolff and Larissa Klinker examine Queen Elizabeth II’s role as the symbol of a centuries-old power structure in the United Kingdom. Although the British monarch has no direct political power, the prime minister travels from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace every week for a private audience. \n\nIn this film, personal secretaries, political experts and Buckingham Palace insiders reveal what is discussed at these private meetings and how much impact personalities have on the relationship between royalty and the government.\n\nUsing archival footage and personal accounts, the film shows how the queen accompanied her prime ministers through their time in office. On September 6, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Liz Truss as the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #QueenElizabeth \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

        ""description"": ""There are heroes, there are villains and there is #BlackAdam Only in theaters October 21.\n\nTHE WORLD NEEDED A HERO… IT GOT BLACK ADAM\n\nFrom New Line Cinema, Dwayne Johnson stars in the action adventure “Black Adam.” The first-ever feature film to explore the story of the DC Super Hero comes to the big screen under the direction of Jaume Collet-Serra (“Jungle Cruise”).\n\nIn ancient Kahndaq, Teth Adam was bestowed the almighty powers of the gods. After using these powers for vengeance, he was imprisoned, becoming Black Adam. Nearly 5,000 years have passed and Black Adam has gone from man, to myth, to legend. Now released, his unique form of justice, born out of rage, is challenged by modern day heroes who form the Justice Society: Hawkman, Dr. Fate, Atom Smasher and Cyclone.\n\nJohnson stars alongside Aldis Hodge (“City on a Hill,” “One Night in Miami”) as Hawkman, Noah Centineo (“To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”) as Atom Smasher, Sarah Shahi (“Sex/Life,” “Rush Hour 3”), Marwan Kenzari (“Murder on the Orient Express,” “The Mummy”), Quintessa Swindell (“Voyagers,” “Trinkets”) as Cyclone, Mo Amer (“Mo,” “Ramy”), Bodhi Sabongui (“A Million Little Things”), and Pierce Brosnan (the “Mamma Mia!” and James Bond franchises) as Dr. Fate.\n\nCollet-Serra directed from a screenplay written by Adam Sztykiel and Rory Haines & Sohrab Noshirvani, based on characters from DC, based on characters created by Bill Parker and C.C. Beck. The film’s producers are Beau Flynn, Hiram Garcia, Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia, with Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Dave Neustadter, Chris Pan, Walter Hamada, Adam Schlagman, Geoff Johns, Eric McLeod and Scott Sheldon executive producing.\n\nThe director’s behind-the-scenes creative team includes Oscar-nominated director of \nphotography Lawrence Sher (“Joker”), production designer Tom Meyer (“Real Steel”), editors Mike Sale (“Red Notice,” “Skyscraper”) and John Lee (“Anyone Home?”), costume designers Kurt and Bart (“Deadpool 2,” “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 & 2”), Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor Bill Westenhofer (“Life of Pi,” “Wonder Woman”), and composer Lorne Balfe (“Black Widow”).\n\nNew Line Cinema Presents a Seven Bucks/Flynn Co. Production, A Jaume Collet-Serra Film, “Black Adam,” smashing into theaters and IMAX internationally beginning 19 October 2022, in North America on October 21, 2022.
