His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#quandorondo #nbayoungboy #rip"",

YoungBoy Never Broke Again)\r\nStream/Download: https://quando.lnk.to/GiveMeASign\r\n\r\nSubscribe for more official content from Quando Rondo: https://1633.lnk.to/QuandoRondoSubscribe\r\n\r\nFollow Quando Rondo\r\nhttps://facebook.com/QuandoRondo\r\nhttps://instagram.com/quando_rondo\r\nhttps://twitter.com/quando_rondo\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/quandorondo\r\n\r\nA natural talent, Quando Rondo was once a small child, secretly singing in the bathroom as a 9-year-old boy in Savannah, GA. His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he’s only only getting better with time.\n\n#quandorondo #nbayoungboy #rip""

        ""description"": ""A late Gabriel goal five minutes from the end ensured we extended our winning start to the campaign to four games as came from behind to beat Fulham 2-1.\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic had put the visitors in front early in the second halfbut we found our way level when Martin Odegaard netted eight minutes later.\n\nBut on 85 minutes the Brazilian defender finished from close-range to ensure a happy ending to Mikel Arteta’s 100th Premier League game as a manager.\n\nUnlike our rip-roaring start against Bournemouth last weekend, the first half was a quiet affair with chances were at a premium, despite us getting in plenty of promising positions within the Fulham half.\n\nOur first decent opportunity arrived on 15 minutes when Granit Xhaka shot wide after some neat play between Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Jesus, and it would take another quarter of an hour for Bernd Leno to be concerned again when Gabriel Martinelli saw a wicked corner strike the top of his crossbar.\n\nThe German shot-stopper was back in familiar surroundings and was called into action again a few minutes later to deny his former teammate Bukayo Saka scoring after he raced through on goalbut Leno saved with his feet, while at the other end Aaron Ramsdale found himself relatively underworked during the opening 45 with Andreas Pereira ballooning a shot well over with the visitors’ best opportunity of the half.\n\nHowever, what the first half lacked, the second made up as both teams came out of the interval with added threat. Bobby De Cordoba-Reid flashed a header over before Mitrovic also miscued with a shot from distance, and then twice in two minutes Leno was called into action, firstly pushing away an Odegaard drive before stretching to claw a Jesus effort away from the bottom corner.\n\nBut back came Fulham to ultimately break the deadlock on 55 minutes. Gabriel hesitated to pick a pass out from the back, and Mitrovic pounced, scooping the ball off the defender and tucking it past Ramsdale in front of the celebrating away fans.\n\nThat setback saw Arteta shuffle his pack as he added some more attacking threat in Eddie Nketiah, and the positivity paid off eight minutes later as we pull level again when Saka slipped a pass in or Odegaard, who saw his shot deflect off Tosin Adarabioyo and decisive Leno.\n\nBoth teams could sense a win was in the offing, and Ramsdale showed great reactions to push away a powerful Mitrovic header from a corner before Ben White’s excellent block thwarted De Cordova-Reid, and Nketiah flashed a shot just wide after cutting inside from the right before hitting straight at Leno when picked out by Gabriel Martinelli as the game entered the final 10 minutes.\n\nWe continued to crank up the pressure and Martinelli saw a fierce curling shot flicked wide by the head of Adarabioyobut with five minutes to go we got ourselves in front. \n\nA Martinelli corner caused havoc in a congested box and Leno failed to claim the ball which dropped at the feet of Gabriel who lashed it home to atone for his error, and after a VAR check for a possible handball, the goal was given to the relief of the majority of the Emirates.\n\nBut the win was only secured when Ramsdale again pulled off a superb save to prevent Nathaniel Chalobah from grabbing a late equaliser, and maintain our 100 per cent record.\n\n#arsenal \n\nSubscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: https://arsn.al/youtube\nFollow us on Facebook: https://arsn.al/facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: https://arsn.al/twitter\nFollow us on Instagram: https://arsn.al/instagram\nFollow us on TikTok: https://arsn.al/tiktok\n\nThis is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.\n\nFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

        ""title"": ""Wie man traditionell vom Baum zum Brett kommt | SWR Handwerkskunst"",
        ""description"": ""Eine 30 Meter hohe Esche im Westerwald. Wie hat man früher, als es noch keine Maschinen gab, einen solchen Baum gefällt und weiterverarbeitet? \n\nZwei Männer aus Härtlingen bei Westerburg wissen noch, wie das ging: Mathias Gläser und Jan Vockel. Die beiden sind Zimmerermeister und geprüfte Restauratoren im Handwerk. Sie fällen die Esche mit Äxten und zersägen dann den Stamm. Danach zeigen sie alte Techniken, wie aus dem Rundholz ein möglichst großer eckiger Balken wird. Sie bringen den Stamm auf einen Bock und \""bebeilen\"" ihn dort. Früher brauchte ein geübter Hauer nur sechs Minuten, um einen Meter des Stammes eckig zu bebeilen. Unsere beiden Protagonisten brauchen zwar etwas länger, aber das Ergebnis überzeugt: ein akkurater Balken, aus dem sie dann Bretter schneiden.\n\nDie \""Handwerkskunst\"" zeigt die traditionelle Bearbeitung von Holz. Eine Arbeit, die anstrengend und schweißtreibend ist.\n\nIM VIDEO\nMathias Gläser, Zimmerermeister und Restaurator im Handwerk\nJan Vockel, Zimmermann\n\nCREDITS\nAutor: Wolfgang Dürr\nKamera: Daniel Mesenholl\nSchnitt: Lodur Tettenborn \nRedaktion: Rolf Hüffer\nSocial Media Redaktion: Land und Leute RP Online\n\nWir freuen uns auf deine Meinung zum Film in den Kommentaren und nicht vergessen: Handwerkskunst abonnieren! - https://www.youtube.com/c/handwerkskunst?sub_confirmation=1\n\nIn \""Handwerkskunst\"" wird in jedem Film ein Handwerk vorgestellt - vom ersten Arbeitsschritt bis zur Vollendung. Mit langen Einstellungen, genauen Beobachtungen, ruhigen Schnittfolgen und ohne störende Hintergrundmusik kann jeder nachvollziehen, wie die Dinge entstehen und begreifen, warum gutes Handwerk auch große Kunst ist.\n\nNetiquette:\nhttps://www.swr.de/netiquette\n\n#Handwerkskunst #Brett #Baum"",

          ""description"": ""Eine 30 Meter hohe Esche im Westerwald. Wie hat man früher, als es noch keine Maschinen gab, einen solchen Baum gefällt und weiterverarbeitet? \n\nZwei Männer aus Härtlingen bei Westerburg wissen noch, wie das ging: Mathias Gläser und Jan Vockel. Die beiden sind Zimmerermeister und geprüfte Restauratoren im Handwerk. Sie fällen die Esche mit Äxten und zersägen dann den Stamm. Danach zeigen sie alte Techniken, wie aus dem Rundholz ein möglichst großer eckiger Balken wird. Sie bringen den Stamm auf einen Bock und \""bebeilen\"" ihn dort. Früher brauchte ein geübter Hauer nur sechs Minuten, um einen Meter des Stammes eckig zu bebeilen. Unsere beiden Protagonisten brauchen zwar etwas länger, aber das Ergebnis überzeugt: ein akkurater Balken, aus dem sie dann Bretter schneiden.\n\nDie \""Handwerkskunst\"" zeigt die traditionelle Bearbeitung von Holz. Eine Arbeit, die anstrengend und schweißtreibend ist.\n\nIM VIDEO\nMathias Gläser, Zimmerermeister und Restaurator im Handwerk\nJan Vockel, Zimmermann\n\nCREDITS\nAutor: Wolfgang Dürr\nKamera: Daniel Mesenholl\nSchnitt: Lodur Tettenborn \nRedaktion: Rolf Hüffer\nSocial Media Redaktion: Land und Leute RP Online\n\nWir freuen uns auf deine Meinung zum Film in den Kommentaren und nicht vergessen: Handwerkskunst abonnieren! - https://www.youtube.com/c/handwerkskunst?sub_confirmation=1\n\nIn \""Handwerkskunst\"" wird in jedem Film ein Handwerk vorgestellt - vom ersten Arbeitsschritt bis zur Vollendung. Mit langen Einstellungen, genauen Beobachtungen, ruhigen Schnittfolgen und ohne störende Hintergrundmusik kann jeder nachvollziehen, wie die Dinge entstehen und begreifen, warum gutes Handwerk auch große Kunst ist.\n\nNetiquette:\nhttps://www.swr.de/netiquette\n\n#Handwerkskunst #Brett #Baum""
