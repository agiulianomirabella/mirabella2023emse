People thought it was just too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn’t satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.\n\nHe imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer’s perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the groundbut since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. \n\nIn a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. \n\nEinstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference\n\nHe imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. \n\nHowever, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can’t be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. \n\nThis was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.\n\nIt’s important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes onlybut it is really in 3D.  \n\nIn order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury’s orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. \n\nBut many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. \n#generalrelativity\n#einstein\nWhy is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. \n\nGeneral relativity does not answer everything. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn’t really tell us what exactly it is."",

You can check out the video herebut just to give you a brief summary, we can say the following.\nUnder the influence of a strong gravitational field, time slows down. So if you’re just hanging out near a massive object, you will experience the effect of time going slower.  \n\nBut gravity isn’t the only thing that can warp time. According to another one of Einstein's theories, special relativity, time slows down for an object when it moves. Combining these two concepts together, we could consider this scenario.\n\nSuppose that we walk up a flight of stairs. Our body is slowly moved away from earth, meaning that we will experience time going faster. But at the same time, since we are not stationary while going up, we should experience time going slower. So being farther from the pull of Earth's gravity causes our clock to tick fasterbut moving “counteracts” this effect. Of course, this is all oversimplified.\n\nLet’s consider two comparable cases. We have person A, floating nearby a massive object with a lot of gravity. And person B, just casually floating in an empty void of space. \nPerson A shines a green laser beam toward person B. Because light is a form of vibration, the laser beam has a color that corresponds to 600 trillion vib/s. Now light is also a form of energy, and as that beam of light comes out of that gravity of the massive object, it loses a lot of energy. This loss means that there’s a decrease in frequency. \n\nSo, by the time that beam of light reaches person B, its frequency will have decreased by some factor. That means that instead of the green light, at six hundred trillion vibrations a sec, person B gets only.. let’s say 10 billion vib/s. Which is a microwave radio beam. This phenomenon is called the gravitational redshift.\n\nIndividual wiggles don't just go anywhere and disappear. Since person A creates 600 trillion wiggles every sec, while person B only gets 10 billion every second, the only way this can happen is if one second on one astronaut’s clock is not the same as one second on the other astronaut.\n\nIn other words, it only takes one sec for person A to create those 600 trillion wigglesbut it will take 60,000 seconds, or nearly a day, for person B to receive them. So this is what happens. Our clocks run at wildly different rates. And by \""clocks\"" I don't just mean mechanical or electronic devicesbut also biological clocks, like your heart, your lungs, your brain, etc. \n\nPerson A takes a breath, takes another breath, and measures a few seconds between the two. For him, everything feels normal. Clocks tick the way they are supposed to. On the other hand person B, watching person A through a telescope, sees everything in slow motion, with several days passing between the two breaths.\n\nSo now revisiting this scene again from #Interstellar, you should get a better understanding as to why Cooper says he will be the same age as his daughter by the time he comes back from the mission.\n\nAccording to Einstein’s special relativity, the greater the acceleration of an object, the slower it will move through time. On Earth, where time is slowed by only a few microseconds per day, gravity’s pull is modest. And at the surface of a black hole, time is slowed to a halt, where the gravity is so humongous that nothing can escape.\n\nIn the movie, Miller’s planet is depicted to be present in the warped space, very close to a black hole Gargantua. Gravity’s pull on Miller’s planet is enormous. So if we apply Einstein’s relativity here, we would know that Miller’s planet would experience time at a very slow rate. But here on Earth, gravity is at a modest rate. And the gravitational force of the sun is also a billion times weaker than Gargantua. So people on Earth “experience time” faster than that of the three astronauts on Miller’s planet."",

        ""description"": ""Some great behind the scenes footage of Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen working together on Revenge Of The Sith. You can really see the synergy between them as artists. Hayden and Ewan really threw themselves into the roles. Their passion for the charcaters really shows. Great to see George doing his thing and being the true father of Star Wars!\n\nEnjoy: https://youtu.be/s5n1H_VTas8\n\nThis footage is Inspiration for the upcoming new Disney Series.

The series stars Ewan McGregor, reprising his role as the iconic Jedi Master, and also marks the return of Hayden Christensen in the role of Darth Vader. Joining the cast are Moses Ingram, Joel Edgerton, Bonnie Piesse, Kumail Nanjiani, Indira Varma, Rupert Friend, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Sung Kang, Simone Kessell and Benny Safdie.\n\n#starwarsfan #darthvader #obiwankenobi"",

        ""description"": ""Watch the exclusive behind the scenes on Red Bull TV 👉 https://www.redbull.com/int-en/episodes/the-ultimate-run-s1-e2\n\n“Sometimes my mind goes kind of crazy about skiing and I ask myself, what if...?” - Markus Eder\n\nWhat if you could link every powder turn, every rail, every cliff drop, every comp run and every kicker nailed into one ultimate run? Well, Markus Eder did just that in ‘The Ultimate Run’!\n\nThis is Markus’ Opus Magnum, a medley of face shots, massive tricks and even bigger drops, which was documented by Innsbruck based production company Legs of Steel over the past two years.\n\nMarkus has been visualizing the ultimate run since 2015. It may look like a simple undertaking in the final editbut for arguably the most versatile skier on the planet, it meant taking his skill levels in every form and style of contemporary freeskiing to the next level.\n\n“All aspects of freeskiing have fascinated me since the beginning”, states Markus.\n\nThe Ultimate Run kicks off on the lofty extremities of Zermatt as Markus drops into a sheer expanse of powder, before shredding his way through glacial blocks the size of buses, jumping off ice cliffs and then slips into the belly of the glacier, only to reappear above his home resort of Klausberg. Carving fields of fresh powder he joins a session with his buddies at his local snowpark, before boosting back off into the backcountry for some more face shots. The firecrackers keep on popping as he enters the snow covered architecture of Taufer castle and a mining museum. As the sun sets over the mountains Markus slides out onto the valley floor, six years of dream skiing condensed into ten minutes of pure joy and adrenaline. \n\nThis edit took over 90 days to film, entirely in the Alps in Markus’ home region. “The Ultimate Run is Markus’ dream project,” says Tobi Reindl from Legs of Steel, “and it also became one of the biggest and most thrilling projects we have done so far.”\n\nWith the first snow falling in the Alps, ‘The Ultimate Run’ is a must watch for all winter sports enthusiasts. It will reignite the passion for winter in even the most laid back snow fans for the coming season.\n\nClick play in the video above and find the answer to the question, “what if?”...\n\nFind out more about The Ultimate Run: www.redbull.com/ultimaterun\n___\nExperience the world of Red Bull Snow like you have never seen it before.

Now after six years and 127 attempts, Tjäder wrote freeskiing history by smashing Wallish’s record after completing a rail measuring 154,49 meters aka 506 feet and 28 inches.\n\nLet your favourite YouTube host@steepsteep  take you backstage as the Olympic Bronze medalist takes on the world's longest metal pipe in Åre, Sweden.\n\n“Being the official Guinness World Record holder feels pretty cool. I have dreamt about it since I was a kid. This rail was a hard challenge, and my guess was that it would take about 525 attemptsbut it went way easier than I expected.” says Jesper Tjäder.\n\nEarlier in May, work began in Stendalen in Åre, Sweden, to build and implement the world's longest rail. After the just over 162 meter (531 feet) long metal rail was in place, it took three days and 127 attempts until the new Guinness World Record was a fact, 154.49 meters or 506 feet 10.28 inches, on May 9th at 5:23pm CEST. Tjäder jumped on the rail at a speed of about 77 kilometers per hour (47.85 mph) and landed with the leading ski on the rail eight meters in.\n___\nExperience the world of Red Bull Snow like you have never seen it before.

        ""description"": ""Watch the exclusive behind the scenes on Red Bull TV 👉 https://www.redbull.com/int-en/episodes/the-ultimate-run-s1-e2\n\n“Sometimes my mind goes kind of crazy about skiing and I ask myself, what if...?” - Markus Eder\n\nWhat if you could link every powder turn, every rail, every cliff drop, every comp run and every kicker nailed into one ultimate run? Well, Markus Eder did just that in ‘The Ultimate Run’!\n\nThis is Markus’ Opus Magnum, a medley of face shots, massive tricks and even bigger drops, which was documented by Innsbruck based production company Legs of Steel over the past two years.\n\nMarkus has been visualizing the ultimate run since 2015. It may look like a simple undertaking in the final editbut for arguably the most versatile skier on the planet, it meant taking his skill levels in every form and style of contemporary freeskiing to the next level.\n\n“All aspects of freeskiing have fascinated me since the beginning”, states Markus.\n\nThe Ultimate Run kicks off on the lofty extremities of Zermatt as Markus drops into a sheer expanse of powder, before shredding his way through glacial blocks the size of buses, jumping off ice cliffs and then slips into the belly of the glacier, only to reappear above his home resort of Klausberg. Carving fields of fresh powder he joins a session with his buddies at his local snowpark, before boosting back off into the backcountry for some more face shots. The firecrackers keep on popping as he enters the snow covered architecture of Taufer castle and a mining museum. As the sun sets over the mountains Markus slides out onto the valley floor, six years of dream skiing condensed into ten minutes of pure joy and adrenaline. \n\nThis edit took over 90 days to film, entirely in the Alps in Markus’ home region. “The Ultimate Run is Markus’ dream project,” says Tobi Reindl from Legs of Steel, “and it also became one of the biggest and most thrilling projects we have done so far.”\n\nWith the first snow falling in the Alps, ‘The Ultimate Run’ is a must watch for all winter sports enthusiasts. It will reignite the passion for winter in even the most laid back snow fans for the coming season.\n\nClick play in the video above and find the answer to the question, “what if?”...\n\nFind out more about The Ultimate Run: www.redbull.com/ultimaterun\n___\nExperience the world of Red Bull Snow like you have never seen it before.

        ""description"": ""Swedish freeskier Jesper Tjäder set his sights on breaking the Guinness World Record for the longest rail slide on skis, which was previously held by legendary freeskier Tom Wallisch. Now after six years and 127 attempts, Tjäder wrote freeskiing history by smashing Wallish’s record after completing a rail measuring 154,49 meters aka 506 feet and 28 inches.\n\nLet your favourite YouTube host@steepsteep  take you backstage as the Olympic Bronze medalist takes on the world's longest metal pipe in Åre, Sweden.\n\n“Being the official Guinness World Record holder feels pretty cool. I have dreamt about it since I was a kid. This rail was a hard challenge, and my guess was that it would take about 525 attemptsbut it went way easier than I expected.” says Jesper Tjäder.\n\nEarlier in May, work began in Stendalen in Åre, Sweden, to build and implement the world's longest rail. After the just over 162 meter (531 feet) long metal rail was in place, it took three days and 127 attempts until the new Guinness World Record was a fact, 154.49 meters or 506 feet 10.28 inches, on May 9th at 5:23pm CEST. Tjäder jumped on the rail at a speed of about 77 kilometers per hour (47.85 mph) and landed with the leading ski on the rail eight meters in.\n___\nExperience the world of Red Bull Snow like you have never seen it before.

        ""title"": ""Snowboarding the Infamous Tunnel Run - Alpe d'Huez - 4K"",
        ""description"": ""With all the resorts around the world closed down I originally thought I would be spending this period split boarding. But the government has issued strict guidelines urging people not to undertake any dangerous activities, which covers everything from surfing and cycling to skateboarding and surfing. Whilst this was a bitter pill to swallow at first,I now realize that it is so as not to put any additional strain on the health services. So here is some footage I shot a few weeks ago of the infamous Tunnel Piste here in Alpe d'Huez!\n\nThe Tunnel Run is one of the steepest pistes in Europe, so steep in fact that the top section cannot even be pisted as the piste bashers can't get up there! It gets its name from the 200m long tunnel which is actually carved through the mountain from one side to the other. This makes for a really cool and unique ski run that I haven't seen anywhere else.\n\nCheck out my new Snowboarding Outerwear here: https://bit.ly/3bu56Rc\n\n360 Camera - https://www.insta360.com/sal/one_x2?insrc=INRUQU3\nAction Camera - https://www.insta360.com/sal/one_r?insrc=INRUQU3\n\nTo support the channel - PayPal Tip Jar: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/malcolmmoore0301\nOr Just go through this link next time you use Booking.com and I'll get 2% comission on your holiday cost instead of them!\nhttps://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=7943142\n\n\nIf you would like to have snowboard lessons with me here in Alpe d'Huez, France, then take a look at my website below to find out more:\n\nhttps://masterclasssnowboarding.com/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/malcolmmooresnowboarding/\n\nI'm Riding Amplid Boards, they good!\nhttp://amplid.com/?sPartner=MalcolmM\n\nIf you're in the UK or Europe, I recommend this shop for buying snowboarding equipment, it costs you nothing but helps me out!\n\nBlue Tomato - https://pn.blue-tomato.com/go.cgi?pid=119&wmid=cc&cpid=1&target=https://www.blue-tomato.com/en-GB/products/categories/Snowboard+Shop-00000000/%3Fcampaign%3Dinternaffiliates%2Fall%2Flinkgenerator%26utm_campaign%3DAll/QualityClick%26ia-pkpmtrack=100-4333136313236323131303-101-162-101\n\nFor Goggles and Sunnies I wear - https://sungod.to/PuTYQNDX/\n\n\nThanks for watching, please like and subscribe if you enjoyed the video!\n\n--- Copyright Info © ---\n➝ Allow to share/embed my video to any sites\n➝ Don't allow copy/re-upload my videos on (YouTube & Facebook)"",

        ""description"": ""Janet Jackson is a groundbreaking artist in pop music. She emerged from the shadows of her brothers -- who were also part of the successful Jackson 5 in the 70s -- and forged an image and successful music career all her own.\n\nEven when her brother Michael Jackson became a global superstar, Janet still held her own, and albums like Janet and The Velvet Rope became her signature works, also cementing her place as a sex symbol.\n\nJanet has had her ups and downs throughout her storied career but she somehow manages to push it aside and reinvent herself every time. And now, her recent new look is turning heads again.\n\n#JanetJackson #Transformation #Music\n\nHumble beginnings | 0:00\nShedding that good girl image | 1:01\nConfronting her demons | 1:38\nAdvocating for the LGBT community | 2:41\nMTV's first-ever icon | 3:36\nThe infamous wardrobe malfunction | 4:17\nHonoring Michael | 5:36\nRevealing her struggles | 6:22\nPaying it forward | 7:07\nLaunching her record label | 7:52\nBecoming a mother | 8:36\nCrushing that body | 9:21\nTaking a stand for equality | 10:36\nPutting in the work | 11:25\n\nRead Full Article: https://www.thelist.com/69370/stunning-transformation-janet-jackson/"",
