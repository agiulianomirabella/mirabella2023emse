So if you’re just hanging out near a massive object, you will experience the effect of time going slower.  \n\nBut gravity isn’t the only thing that can warp time. According to another one of Einstein's theories, special relativity, time slows down for an object when it moves. Combining these two concepts together, we could consider this scenario.\n\nSuppose that we walk up a flight of stairs. Our body is slowly moved away from earth, meaning that we will experience time going faster. But at the same time, since we are not stationary while going up, we should experience time going slower. So being farther from the pull of Earth's gravity causes our clock to tick fasterbut moving “counteracts” this effect. Of course, this is all oversimplified.\n\nLet’s consider two comparable cases. We have person A, floating nearby a massive object with a lot of gravity. And person B, just casually floating in an empty void of space. \nPerson A shines a green laser beam toward person B. Because light is a form of vibration, the laser beam has a color that corresponds to 600 trillion vib/s. Now light is also a form of energy, and as that beam of light comes out of that gravity of the massive object, it loses a lot of energy. This loss means that there’s a decrease in frequency. \n\nSo, by the time that beam of light reaches person B, its frequency will have decreased by some factor. That means that instead of the green light, at six hundred trillion vibrations a sec, person B gets only.. let’s say 10 billion vib/s. Which is a microwave radio beam. This phenomenon is called the gravitational redshift.\n\nIndividual wiggles don't just go anywhere and disappear. Since person A creates 600 trillion wiggles every sec, while person B only gets 10 billion every second, the only way this can happen is if one second on one astronaut’s clock is not the same as one second on the other astronaut.\n\nIn other words, it only takes one sec for person A to create those 600 trillion wigglesbut it will take 60,000 seconds, or nearly a day, for person B to receive them. So this is what happens. Our clocks run at wildly different rates. And by \""clocks\"" I don't just mean mechanical or electronic devicesbut also biological clocks, like your heart, your lungs, your brain, etc. \n\nPerson A takes a breath, takes another breath, and measures a few seconds between the two. For him, everything feels normal. Clocks tick the way they are supposed to. On the other hand person B, watching person A through a telescope, sees everything in slow motion, with several days passing between the two breaths.\n\nSo now revisiting this scene again from #Interstellar, you should get a better understanding as to why Cooper says he will be the same age as his daughter by the time he comes back from the mission.\n\nAccording to Einstein’s special relativity, the greater the acceleration of an object, the slower it will move through time. On Earth, where time is slowed by only a few microseconds per day, gravity’s pull is modest. And at the surface of a black hole, time is slowed to a halt, where the gravity is so humongous that nothing can escape.\n\nIn the movie, Miller’s planet is depicted to be present in the warped space, very close to a black hole Gargantua. Gravity’s pull on Miller’s planet is enormous. So if we apply Einstein’s relativity here, we would know that Miller’s planet would experience time at a very slow rate. But here on Earth, gravity is at a modest rate. And the gravitational force of the sun is also a billion times weaker than Gargantua. So people on Earth “experience time” faster than that of the three astronauts on Miller’s planet."",

        ""description"": ""A circle is 360 degrees But have you ever thought why is a circle not a simpler number, like 10 degrees or 100 degrees? As it turns out 360 is actually a very good number. From a purely mathematical standpoint, a number like 10 or 100 would have been more inconvenient.\n\nYou see, the number 360 is divisible by every number from 1 to 10, aside from 7. In addition to that, 360 has 24 divisors. This is the highest number of divisors for any positive whole number up to its own value of 360. This is just one of the reasons why a circle is 360 degrees. \n\nIn this video, we have discussed some other reasons that make 360 an idea number for calculations.\n\n#circle #geometry #mathematics\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/scienceabcofficial/ \n\nFollow us on LinkedIn!\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/scienceabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com"",

        ""title"": ""The Science of Extreme Time Dilation in Interstellar"",
        ""description"": ""For every one hour on Miller's planet, time elapses roughly 7 years on Earth. How is that possible? In this fun video, we'll explore the science behind #Time #Dilation.\nWatch part 2 of the Interstellar series: https://youtu.be/ML7mh_2_MUE\n\nVisit https://brilliant.org/BeeyondIdeas/ to get started learning STEM for free.

You can check out the video herebut just to give you a brief summary, we can say the following.\nUnder the influence of a strong gravitational field, time slows down. So if you’re just hanging out near a massive object, you will experience the effect of time going slower.  \n\nBut gravity isn’t the only thing that can warp time. According to another one of Einstein's theories, special relativity, time slows down for an object when it moves. Combining these two concepts together, we could consider this scenario.\n\nSuppose that we walk up a flight of stairs. Our body is slowly moved away from earth, meaning that we will experience time going faster. But at the same time, since we are not stationary while going up, we should experience time going slower. So being farther from the pull of Earth's gravity causes our clock to tick fasterbut moving “counteracts” this effect. Of course, this is all oversimplified.\n\nLet’s consider two comparable cases. We have person A, floating nearby a massive object with a lot of gravity. And person B, just casually floating in an empty void of space. \nPerson A shines a green laser beam toward person B. Because light is a form of vibration, the laser beam has a color that corresponds to 600 trillion vib/s. Now light is also a form of energy, and as that beam of light comes out of that gravity of the massive object, it loses a lot of energy. This loss means that there’s a decrease in frequency. \n\nSo, by the time that beam of light reaches person B, its frequency will have decreased by some factor. That means that instead of the green light, at six hundred trillion vibrations a sec, person B gets only.. let’s say 10 billion vib/s. Which is a microwave radio beam. This phenomenon is called the gravitational redshift.\n\nIndividual wiggles don't just go anywhere and disappear. Since person A creates 600 trillion wiggles every sec, while person B only gets 10 billion every second, the only way this can happen is if one second on one astronaut’s clock is not the same as one second on the other astronaut.\n\nIn other words, it only takes one sec for person A to create those 600 trillion wigglesbut it will take 60,000 seconds, or nearly a day, for person B to receive them. So this is what happens. Our clocks run at wildly different rates. And by \""clocks\"" I don't just mean mechanical or electronic devicesbut also biological clocks, like your heart, your lungs, your brain, etc. \n\nPerson A takes a breath, takes another breath, and measures a few seconds between the two. For him, everything feels normal. Clocks tick the way they are supposed to. On the other hand person B, watching person A through a telescope, sees everything in slow motion, with several days passing between the two breaths.\n\nSo now revisiting this scene again from #Interstellar, you should get a better understanding as to why Cooper says he will be the same age as his daughter by the time he comes back from the mission.\n\nAccording to Einstein’s special relativity, the greater the acceleration of an object, the slower it will move through time. On Earth, where time is slowed by only a few microseconds per day, gravity’s pull is modest. And at the surface of a black hole, time is slowed to a halt, where the gravity is so humongous that nothing can escape.\n\nIn the movie, Miller’s planet is depicted to be present in the warped space, very close to a black hole Gargantua. Gravity’s pull on Miller’s planet is enormous. So if we apply Einstein’s relativity here, we would know that Miller’s planet would experience time at a very slow rate. But here on Earth, gravity is at a modest rate. And the gravitational force of the sun is also a billion times weaker than Gargantua. So people on Earth “experience time” faster than that of the three astronauts on Miller’s planet."",

From a purely mathematical standpoint, a number like 10 or 100 would have been more inconvenient.\n\nYou see, the number 360 is divisible by every number from 1 to 10, aside from 7. In addition to that, 360 has 24 divisors. This is the highest number of divisors for any positive whole number up to its own value of 360. This is just one of the reasons why a circle is 360 degrees. \n\nIn this video, we have discussed some other reasons that make 360 an idea number for calculations.\n\n#circle #geometry #mathematics\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/scienceabcofficial/ \n\nFollow us on LinkedIn!\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/scienceabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com"",

        ""description"": ""Watch the exclusive behind the scenes on Red Bull TV 👉 https://www.redbull.com/int-en/episodes/the-ultimate-run-s1-e2\n\n“Sometimes my mind goes kind of crazy about skiing and I ask myself, what if...?” - Markus Eder\n\nWhat if you could link every powder turn, every rail, every cliff drop, every comp run and every kicker nailed into one ultimate run? Well, Markus Eder did just that in ‘The Ultimate Run’!\n\nThis is Markus’ Opus Magnum, a medley of face shots, massive tricks and even bigger drops, which was documented by Innsbruck based production company Legs of Steel over the past two years.\n\nMarkus has been visualizing the ultimate run since 2015. It may look like a simple undertaking in the final editbut for arguably the most versatile skier on the planet, it meant taking his skill levels in every form and style of contemporary freeskiing to the next level.\n\n“All aspects of freeskiing have fascinated me since the beginning”, states Markus.\n\nThe Ultimate Run kicks off on the lofty extremities of Zermatt as Markus drops into a sheer expanse of powder, before shredding his way through glacial blocks the size of buses, jumping off ice cliffs and then slips into the belly of the glacier, only to reappear above his home resort of Klausberg. Carving fields of fresh powder he joins a session with his buddies at his local snowpark, before boosting back off into the backcountry for some more face shots. The firecrackers keep on popping as he enters the snow covered architecture of Taufer castle and a mining museum. As the sun sets over the mountains Markus slides out onto the valley floor, six years of dream skiing condensed into ten minutes of pure joy and adrenaline. \n\nThis edit took over 90 days to film, entirely in the Alps in Markus’ home region. “The Ultimate Run is Markus’ dream project,” says Tobi Reindl from Legs of Steel, “and it also became one of the biggest and most thrilling projects we have done so far.”\n\nWith the first snow falling in the Alps, ‘The Ultimate Run’ is a must watch for all winter sports enthusiasts. It will reignite the passion for winter in even the most laid back snow fans for the coming season.\n\nClick play in the video above and find the answer to the question, “what if?”...\n\nFind out more about The Ultimate Run: www.redbull.com/ultimaterun\n___\nExperience the world of Red Bull Snow like you have never seen it before. With the best snow action sports clips on YouTube and original series,  from skiing to snowboarding, prepare for your \""stoke factor\"" to be at an all time high.\n\nSubscribe to Red Bull Snow on Youtube: https://win.gs/SubToRedBullSnow\n\nGet the FREE Red Bull TV apps for all your devices:  https://go.onelink.me/351027264/35a30660\n\nRed Bull Snow on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RedBullSnow/\n\nRed Bull Snow on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/redbullsnow"",

        ""description"": ""Watch the exclusive behind the scenes on Red Bull TV 👉 https://www.redbull.com/int-en/episodes/the-ultimate-run-s1-e2\n\n“Sometimes my mind goes kind of crazy about skiing and I ask myself, what if...?” - Markus Eder\n\nWhat if you could link every powder turn, every rail, every cliff drop, every comp run and every kicker nailed into one ultimate run? Well, Markus Eder did just that in ‘The Ultimate Run’!\n\nThis is Markus’ Opus Magnum, a medley of face shots, massive tricks and even bigger drops, which was documented by Innsbruck based production company Legs of Steel over the past two years.\n\nMarkus has been visualizing the ultimate run since 2015. It may look like a simple undertaking in the final editbut for arguably the most versatile skier on the planet, it meant taking his skill levels in every form and style of contemporary freeskiing to the next level.\n\n“All aspects of freeskiing have fascinated me since the beginning”, states Markus.\n\nThe Ultimate Run kicks off on the lofty extremities of Zermatt as Markus drops into a sheer expanse of powder, before shredding his way through glacial blocks the size of buses, jumping off ice cliffs and then slips into the belly of the glacier, only to reappear above his home resort of Klausberg. Carving fields of fresh powder he joins a session with his buddies at his local snowpark, before boosting back off into the backcountry for some more face shots. The firecrackers keep on popping as he enters the snow covered architecture of Taufer castle and a mining museum. As the sun sets over the mountains Markus slides out onto the valley floor, six years of dream skiing condensed into ten minutes of pure joy and adrenaline. \n\nThis edit took over 90 days to film, entirely in the Alps in Markus’ home region. “The Ultimate Run is Markus’ dream project,” says Tobi Reindl from Legs of Steel, “and it also became one of the biggest and most thrilling projects we have done so far.”\n\nWith the first snow falling in the Alps, ‘The Ultimate Run’ is a must watch for all winter sports enthusiasts. It will reignite the passion for winter in even the most laid back snow fans for the coming season.\n\nClick play in the video above and find the answer to the question, “what if?”...\n\nFind out more about The Ultimate Run: www.redbull.com/ultimaterun\n___\nExperience the world of Red Bull Snow like you have never seen it before.

        ""description"": ""En LOS40 Music Awards 2020 pusimos a prueba a los artistas con nuestro reto encadenado ¿Las reglas del juego? Muy fáciles. Nosotros planteamos un reto al primer artista y éste tenía que aceptarlo y retar al siguiente a lo que quisiera: cantar, bailar, imitar o hacer cualquier disparate que se le pasara por la cabeza en ese momento.\n\nPropusimos a David Otero comenzar cantando su última canción usando solo la \""a\"" como única vocal. El artista cumplió y lanzó su reto para Willy de Taburete y éste a su vez lanzó su locura para el siguiente invitado hasta forma un reto encadenado impredecible y muy loco.\n\nLola Índigo, David Otero, Beret, Lali, Pablo Alborán, Ana Guerra, Bombai, Manuel Carrasco, Camilo, Ana Mena, Dani Fernández o David Bisbal fueron algunos de los cantantes que se dejaron la piel en el desafío de LOS40. Pero también otros rostros conocidos como Vanesa Romero o Dulceida.\n\nSi quieres música y entretenimiento, cine y TV, bromas o juegos y challenges con los artistas, influencers y celebrities del momento, no olvides suscribirte a nuestro canal:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=los40principales\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nNuestras redes sociales:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Los40\nhttps://www.facebook.com/los40/\nhttp://instagram.com/los40spain\n\nEscucha la radio más global y con mejores canciones del momento: https://play.los40.com/\nNuestra hermana mayor, LOS40 Classic, una radio llena de los grandes éxitos de los años 80 o los 90:\nhttps://play.los40.com/emisora/los40_classic/\nLa mejor música dance, en LOS40 Dance: https://play.los40.com/emisora/los40_dance/\nO perrea con LOS40 Urban:\nhttps://play.los40.com/emisora/los40_urban/\nConsulta el chart musical más potente del mundo hispanohablante: la Lista de LOS40: http://los40.com/lista40/?o=VL40\n\nY diviértete con nosotros y con los cantantes y grupos más exitosos del momento: http://los40.com/\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n#LOS40 #Reto #Artistas"",
