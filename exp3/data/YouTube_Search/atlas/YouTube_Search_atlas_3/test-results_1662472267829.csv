People thought it was just too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn’t satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.\n\nHe imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer’s perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the groundbut since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. \n\nIn a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. \n\nEinstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference\n\nHe imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. \n\nHowever, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can’t be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. \n\nThis was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.\n\nIt’s important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes onlybut it is really in 3D.  \n\nIn order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury’s orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. \n\nBut many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. \n#generalrelativity\n#einstein\nWhy is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. \n\nGeneral relativity does not answer everything. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn’t really tell us what exactly it is."",

You can check out the video herebut just to give you a brief summary, we can say the following.\nUnder the influence of a strong gravitational field, time slows down. So if you’re just hanging out near a massive object, you will experience the effect of time going slower.  \n\nBut gravity isn’t the only thing that can warp time. According to another one of Einstein's theories, special relativity, time slows down for an object when it moves. Combining these two concepts together, we could consider this scenario.\n\nSuppose that we walk up a flight of stairs. Our body is slowly moved away from earth, meaning that we will experience time going faster. But at the same time, since we are not stationary while going up, we should experience time going slower. So being farther from the pull of Earth's gravity causes our clock to tick fasterbut moving “counteracts” this effect. Of course, this is all oversimplified.\n\nLet’s consider two comparable cases. We have person A, floating nearby a massive object with a lot of gravity. And person B, just casually floating in an empty void of space. \nPerson A shines a green laser beam toward person B. Because light is a form of vibration, the laser beam has a color that corresponds to 600 trillion vib/s. Now light is also a form of energy, and as that beam of light comes out of that gravity of the massive object, it loses a lot of energy. This loss means that there’s a decrease in frequency. \n\nSo, by the time that beam of light reaches person B, its frequency will have decreased by some factor. That means that instead of the green light, at six hundred trillion vibrations a sec, person B gets only.. let’s say 10 billion vib/s. Which is a microwave radio beam. This phenomenon is called the gravitational redshift.\n\nIndividual wiggles don't just go anywhere and disappear. Since person A creates 600 trillion wiggles every sec, while person B only gets 10 billion every second, the only way this can happen is if one second on one astronaut’s clock is not the same as one second on the other astronaut.\n\nIn other words, it only takes one sec for person A to create those 600 trillion wigglesbut it will take 60,000 seconds, or nearly a day, for person B to receive them. So this is what happens. Our clocks run at wildly different rates. And by \""clocks\"" I don't just mean mechanical or electronic devicesbut also biological clocks, like your heart, your lungs, your brain, etc. \n\nPerson A takes a breath, takes another breath, and measures a few seconds between the two. For him, everything feels normal. Clocks tick the way they are supposed to. On the other hand person B, watching person A through a telescope, sees everything in slow motion, with several days passing between the two breaths.\n\nSo now revisiting this scene again from #Interstellar, you should get a better understanding as to why Cooper says he will be the same age as his daughter by the time he comes back from the mission.\n\nAccording to Einstein’s special relativity, the greater the acceleration of an object, the slower it will move through time. On Earth, where time is slowed by only a few microseconds per day, gravity’s pull is modest. And at the surface of a black hole, time is slowed to a halt, where the gravity is so humongous that nothing can escape.\n\nIn the movie, Miller’s planet is depicted to be present in the warped space, very close to a black hole Gargantua. Gravity’s pull on Miller’s planet is enormous. So if we apply Einstein’s relativity here, we would know that Miller’s planet would experience time at a very slow rate. But here on Earth, gravity is at a modest rate. And the gravitational force of the sun is also a billion times weaker than Gargantua. So people on Earth “experience time” faster than that of the three astronauts on Miller’s planet."",

        ""title"": ""Special Relativity simplified using no math. Einstein thought experiments"",
        ""description"": ""Einstein's Special Relativity Explained Simply - no math\n\nThis entire revolution in physics started with a simple thought experiments, in the prolific imagination before Einstein even graduated from high school.  Einstein’s theory of special relativity is convention today. But to understand how revolutionary it was for its time, it is helpful to look at what the conventional understanding of physics was during the time of Einstein’s teenage years.\n\nIn 1801, Thomas Young had conducted a simple double slit experiment that showed that light behaved like a wave. So the  theory about light at the time was that it was a wave.  The problem is that a wave, it was thought, had to move through some sort of medium. They called this substance the luminiferous aether.  \n\nBut in 1887, two scientists by the name of Albert Michelson and Edward Morely came up with an idea to test the existence of the aether. The background ether was believed to be unmoving and static, so if the wave was traveling in the same direction as the earth, the speed of the wave should be higher in the direction of the speed of the earth. Michelson and Morley showed that there was no difference in the speed of light of the two measurements. This seriously jeopardized the aether theory.  \n\nEinstein knew this, so he came up with a thought experiment as a 16 year old.  His thought was to imagine that he was chasing a beam of light while traveling at the speed of light himself.  What would he see? If young Albert could catch up to the beam, he should see a stationary wave.\n\nYet that was impossible. Einstein knew such stationary fields would violate the equations of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk Maxwell 20 years earlier. \n\nSo he came up with two postulates, and tried to figure out what the physics would be if the two postulates were true.\nPostulate 1 was that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial reference frames. \nPostulate 2 was that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all inertial reference frames.  \n\nThe first postulate had been assumed for hundreds of years. The second postulate, however, was the revolution. \n\nThis meant that young Einstein would never see the stationary, oscillating fields, because he could never catch the light beam.\nBut this solution seemed to have fatal flaw. Einstein later explained the problem with another thought experiment: \n\nImagine firing a light beam along a railroad embankment just as a train roars by in the same direction at, say, 2,000 miles a second. Someone standing on the embankment would measure the light beam’s speed to be the standard number, 186,000 miles a second. But someone on the train would see it moving past at only 184,000 miles a second. \n\nIf the speed of light was not constant, Maxwell’s equations would somehow have to look different inside the railcar, and the first postulate would be violated. The solution to his thought experiment was that observers in relative motion experience time differently. This completely overturned hundreds of years of classical physics in which time was absolute in the universe.  Einstein showed that time is relative, and varies in different frames of reference. The idea of the aether was no longer needed. \n   \nThis one realization that reality is not the same for different frames of reference also led to other implications of special relativity:\nThat Fast moving object appear shorter\nThat Fast moving objects appears to have increased mass \nAnd finally, the most famous equation in science E=MC2\nThat mass and energy are equivalent.\n\nSo, how did Einstein come up with his most famous equation based on his original two postulates? Let’s look at this conceptually.  \n\nIf conservation of mass is interpreted as conservation of rest mass, this did not hold true in special relativity. Since different observers would disagree about what the energy of a system was, the mass and energy taken together must be conserved, not just the mass on its own. \n\nIt turns out that for the laws of physics, namely conservation of energy and momentum, to be consistent in the two \""reference frames\"" of two observers moving with respect to each other, there has to be an energy associated with a body at rest, not just a body in motion. And that is what E=MC2 implies – the M in the equation is the mass at rest.  \n\nSome people point out that much of the actual work for special relativity had already been done by the time Einstein presented it. The concepts of time dilation for moving objects, were already in place and the mathematics had already been developed by Lorentz & Poincare. Einstein still deserves the accolades because he rejected the idea of the ether all together which other scientists had not done, and the idea of mass and energy equivalence via E=MC2 is solely Einstein. Scientists who had done prior work like Thomson, Larmor, Lorentz, or Poincare had never implied such a bold proposition. \n\n#specialrelativity\n#einstein\n#michelsonmorley"",

        ""description"": ""A simple and clear explanation of all the important features of quantum physics that you need to know. Check out this video's sponsor https://brilliant.org/dos \nI have spent a lot of time thinking about how best to explain quantum physics and this is the result of all my hours of pondering, and I’m really happy with how it turned out. I decided to just explain it as it actually is, rather than rely on analogies. The video explains the quantum wavefunction, particle-wave duality, the measurement problem, the double-slit experiment, superposition, entanglement, quantum tunnelling, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and energy quantisation. Let me know if it was helpful!

More precise time-keeping eventually came along to put time in more convenient boxes. But what exactly are we measuring? Andrew Zimmerman Jones contemplates whether time is something that physically exists or is just in our heads.\n\n\nLesson by Andrew Zimmerman Jones, directed by Nice Shoes.\n\nThank you so much to our patrons for your support!

But Tesla also had an eidetic memory and could memorize entire books after reading them once, while Einstein had to study hard to remember facts for tests at school. Tesla had an IQ of 187, which is considered “gifted” by psychologists’ standards . Einstein, by comparison, had an IQ of 160, which is considered \""genius\"" but not nearly as high as Tesla’s.  The two great minds were friends and colleagues at the beginning of their careersbut the relationship turned sour when they disagreed over whether or not light has mass. Tesla believed it did , while Einstein held that it didn’t . They continued to argue over this for years, until one day Tesla finally decided to settle it once and for all: he challenged Einstein to a game of chess! If Einstein won, Tesla would have to come around to his way of thinking about light; if Tesla won… well… we’ll get to that later.\nEinstein accepted the challenge, and they began playing in a coffee shop on New York City’s Lexington Avenue in front of witnesses who had gathered around to watch history being made. After just five moves by each player , Einstein realized he didn’t stand a chance against his friend’s superior strategy and conceded defeat.\n\n📺 Watch the entire video for more information!\n\n#nikolatesla #nikolatesla369 #nikolatesladocumentary\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nAbout Neuro Sign\n🎥 Videos about Nikola Tesla\n🎨 Written, voiced and produced by Neuro Sign\n🔔 Subscribe now for more Nikola Tesla videos\n\nWatch More from Neuro Sign\n🟢 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKJnMSz4d9Nat71Gav1xTHg/\n_____________________________________________________\n\n💼 Business Inquiries and Contact\n• For business inquiries, copyright matters or other inquiries please contact us at: neurosignyt@gmail.com\n\n❓ Copyright Questions\n• If you have any copyright questions or issues you can contact us at neurosignyt@gmail.com\n\n⚠️ Copyright Disclaimers\n• We use images and content in accordance with the YouTube Fair Use copyright guidelines\n• Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act states: “Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.” \n• This video could contain certain copyrighted video clips, pictures, or photographs that were not specifically authorized to be used by the copyright holder(s)but which we believe in good faith are protected by federal law and the fair use doctrine for one or more of the reasons noted above."",

        ""title"": ""How Einstein Thought of the Theory of Relativity"",
        ""description"": ""In 1895, a 16-year-old boy imagined himself chasing a beam of light. This thought eventually changed the world forever. So how could one thought change the world so thoroughly? In this video we’re discussing Einstein’s theory of relativity and how he got there. \n\nIf you'd like to see more of this kind of video, consider supporting our work by becoming a member today!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/BeeyondIdeas/join\n\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/beeyond.ideas/\n\nScript:\nWe cannot start talking about Einstein without discussing a classical physicist Sir Isaac Newton. In 1687, Newton published his book “Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy”. In the book, he described his three Laws of Motion and the Law of Gravity. His book is considered one of the most important writings in the history of mankind. After watching an apple fall, he asked himself a question. And if the apple falls, does the moon also fall? These questions led him to discover the Law of Gravity.\n\nAccording to his Law of Gravitation, every object in the universe enacts its own force of attraction on another object. And this force is the reason why we are stuck on Earth, why the moon orbits the Earth, and indeed, why the universe exists. But that didn’t answer all of Newton’s questions. Like, why do objects attract each other? What is the source of gravity? And why does Mercury's orbit jiggle? \n\nThe rest remained a mystery until the era of Albert Einstein. In 1915, #Einstein published his Theory of General #Relativity, or in other words, his theory of #Gravity. In this theory, Einstein explained gravity and its source. He answered all the questions that Newton couldn’t, like Mercury’s precession. \n\nLet’s take a step back here to 1905, to truly grasp where these different pieces of the puzzle come to life. This year, Einstein published his Theory of Special Relativity. It deals with the speed of light and the motion of objects. It was fine with non-accelerating objectsbut the theory did not apply when gravity was present, or if the object was accelerating. He couldn’t quite figure the rest out. Until one fine day in 1907. He was observing a window washer on a ladder and had an epiphany. \n\nHe thought about what he would be experiencing while falling. He imagined himself there and realized that while falling, the ground would not be pushing him, so he would be in a free fall. That put some of the pieces togetherbut he still wasn’t fully finished. He began to think about falling again, this time he imagined himself in a room with no windows. On the surface of the Earth, you would weigh whatever your weight is now. But imagine if the room was in a spacecraft, moving in an upward direction with the same 9.8 meters per second squared as here on the ground. In that moment, if you were to weigh yourself, you would weigh the same as you do on Earth. Einstein realized that the observer would not be able to tell if he is on a spaceship, or on the surface of the Earth. That is because he would be moving at the exact same rate of acceleration. There would be no way to tell the difference. \n\nThis phenomenon is called the Equivalence Principle, which states that an object that is accelerating free of any gravitational pull is essentially no different than the same object that is stationary but affected by gravity. In other words, something moving in space with no gravity has the same mass as something on earth that is not moving. In his special theory of relativity, he could only deal with non-accelerating objects and the speed of light. \n\nLet’s pause here for a second. This means that at that point, he knew how to unify his theory of special relativity with gravity. Luckily, he didn’t stop there. He did another thought experiment. This time he imagined what would happen if he pointed a laser beam from one side of the room towards the other. If the room were in a spaceship that was moving upwards with the same acceleration rate as earth, the height of the beam would slightly be lower on the other side of the room. As the floor moved up, it curved the light and caused it to bend down. But, this principle only applied in space. When he thought about the same experiment on earth, the light would appear to be straight. Of course, these two scenarios only happened in his brain. Let’s just take a brief moment to appreciate how brilliant he is to be able to conduct that experiment, all of that, in his brain. \n\nEinstein wasn’t convinced though, as this violated the principle of equivalence. The acceleration of the room on the spaceship was the same as under the influence of gravity. The heights should be the same in both cases, so why were they different? He realized that the only possibility could be that the light beam must be bending under the gravitational influence. But how could this be? What does this bending of light mean?"",

        ""description"": ""🌏 Get the exclusive NordVPN deal using this link https://nordvpn.com/beeyondideas 😎\nIt’s risk-free with NordVPN’s 30 day money back guarantee!\n\nWhat exactly is a tesseract? How could such a hyper-cubic, grid-like chamber becomes like a time machine? In this fun video, we'll explore the science behind #Interstellar #Tesseract\n\nIf you'd like to see more of this kind of video, consider supporting our work by becoming a member today!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/BeeyondIdeas/join\n\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/beeyond.ideas/\n\nTimecode:\n0:00 Teaser\n0:53 Entering a black hole\n1:57 Accessing the fourth dimension\n4:49 The \""hidden\"" layer\n6:43 Backward-in-time gravitational force\n8:01 Interstellar's plot: a paradox\n\n***\n\nScript:\n\nThe initial question to ask here is how Cooper got into the tesseract in the first place. From the film, we know that it is because he intends to lighten the Endurance’s load so that Dr. Brand can reach Edmunds’ planet. So he flings himself and goes directly into the blackhole Gargantua.\n\nBut you might be asking: how could you enter a black hole and emerge alive at the other end? You may have heard that when someone are pulled into into a blackhole, their bodies could be stretched to the size of a spaghetti strand. In addition, if you approach the blackhole on a normal, perpedicular trajectory, your body will split into 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.\n\nHowever, because the film indicates that this is a spinning blackhole, this phenomenon does not occur. And in principle, you should be able to escape the bifurcation of your body by following a specific trajectory.\n\nNow.. as we are falling towards a black hole, time for us is gonna flow more slowly than the rest of the universe. And once Cooper is inside, time will stop flowing for him, according to an outside observer. When Cooper gets to a chamber, he realizes that this 4 dimensional hypercube is in fact, a manifestation of Murph’s actual bedroom at a particular moment of time.\n\n----\n\nFirst and foremost, we must state the obvious. Interstellar's science encompasses all four areas of physics: Newtonian, relativistic, quantum, and quantum gravity. In our current understanding of quantum gravity, our universe is a membrane, or as physicst would like to call it, a brane. This is the place where you, I, and everything else that exists or have existed, lay.\n\nThis brane resides in \""hyperspace,\"" which is a higher-dimensional space. And at this point in time, this notion falls within the educated guesses. This is what the warped brane would look like if viewed from a hyperspace.\n\nIn reality, black holes are formed of warped space and warped time, which are made of components from the same brane that we are familiar with. As a result, the idea that the singularity leads to a portal, which would then enable access to hyperspace, is purely speculative.\n\nBut we're not done yet. Let's pretend that may happen, for the sake of the movie. Through this blackhole, Cooper escapes our universe brane and use it as a bridge into hyperspace. Essentially, allowing him to enter the tesseract, a chamber that extends from the singularity of the blackhole into hyperspace.\n\nFirst of all, the back face of the tesseract corresponds with Murphy’s bedroom. So everything in her bedroom, including herself, is somehow inside the tesseract’s back face. And one particular moment in time could be observed in six different viewing angles. It might come from above, while also on the right side simultaneously.\n\nThe second thing, we see that the bedroom has extrusions all around the tesseract, with two directions transverse to Cooper's chamber. Cross sections through the room that are vertical, travel upward with the passage of time. With the same notion, the cross sections that are horizontal, travel rightward as time passes. Essentially this cross section depicts a different viewing angle of Murph’s bedroom. Where the two extrusions intersect, there is a moment in the bedroom that you could observe its current “present”. An actual moment of time. This is where the movie defines it as “while extrusions are extending, time is flowing along them”. \n\nCooper has the ability to travel faster than the flow of time in the extrusions, allowing him to explore the tesseract complex. In summary, this weird psychedelic vortex was merely our normal spacetimebut with one temporal dimension, or time, manifested as an acessible spatial dimension. In this chamber, Cooper could simply go forward and backward in time, as simple as moving diagonally up and down through the tesseract complex. \n\n----\n\nIt’s noted from the movie that physical objects and fields having three spatial dimensions, such as humans, light, and information, cannot move backward in time. From one point in our brane to another. Just like the information about Murph in the past can go to Cooper in the tesseract in the futurebut it cannot travel back in time from Cooper to younger Murph."",

        ""title"": ""Faster Than Light Speed Travel With Neil deGrasse Tyson"",
        ""description"": ""Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson explains the possibility of going faster than the speed of light. If we look at the Einstein's special relativity theory, the speed of light in vacuum has constant velocity of 186,282 miles per second.  If you could travel at this speed, you could go around the Earth 7.5 times in one second. \n\n\n\nIn 1994, Miguel Alcubierre proposed a method that would take us beyond the speed of light limit.  In his mathematical theory, he used two points in space-time to demonstrate the expansion and contraction of space fabric. The idea of Alcubierre's theory was that we could use this space-time warp to make an object travel faster than light.\n\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson takes examples from science fiction works like Star Trek to demonstrate and explain how an advanced civilization could be capable of manipulating the fabric of space-time itself in order to travel faster than the speed of light.\n\n\nEinstein's theory of special relativity states that energy and mass are interchangeable, and speed of light travel is impossible for material objects that, unlike photons, have a non-zero rest mass.\n\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson explains how Einstein's theory of general relativity allows for time itself to slow down if you travel at relativistic velocity\n\n\nEinstein's theory of general relativity mathematically predicts the existence of wormholesbut none have been discovered to date. Even if a wormhole could form, it would most likely be very unstable. Wormholes are still speculative because nobody really knows if you could pass through it. The math suggests that you need some sort of exotic material to pry the throat of the wormhole opening so that it wont collapse in on it self. Even then it is possibly unstable.\n\n\n#neiltyson #science #lightspeed\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our channel \""Science Time\"": https://www.youtube.com/sciencetime24\nSUPPORT us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sciencetime\nBUY Science Time Merch: https://teespring.com/science-time-merch\n\n\nSources:\nJose Luis Blázquez-Salcedo, Christian Knoll, Eugen Radu.

These are three spatial dimensions and one time dimension in the universe. With these 4 coordinates, you could rendezvous with anyone anywhere in the universe. In fact these 4 dimensions can describe any event in the universe. \n  \nBut how did the idea of time as a dimension come about? How can we best visualize these 4 dimensions? And what really happens when space and time start doing seemingly weird things when two objects move relative to each other? \n\nIn the late 1800’s, scientists had recognized that there was an inconsistency between two theories – Newton’s laws of motion, and Maxwell’s equations describing electricity and magnetism. The problem was the speed of light. \n\nMaxwell had shown that light was a self-propagating electromagnetic wave. And his theory predicted its speed to be about 300,000 km/s. \n\nThe question was what would the measured speed of light be if the person measuring it was moving. According to Newton, this moving observer should measure a different speed, than someone who was not moving. The measured speed should be the speed of the person, PLUS the speed of light. \n\nIn 1887, Michelson and Morley devised a highly sensitive experiment to measure the speed of light in the direction of motion of the earth. They found that the speed of light does not vary at all, due to the motion of the earth. A resolution of this unexpected result came from Albert Einstein who proposed that Newton’s laws of motion needed to be modified. He determined that the speed of light does not change in any reference frame, and worked out the implications of this idea. \n\nEinstein showed that observers moving at different speeds will disagree about distance and time between two events. In other words, they will experience space and time differently. \n\nHermann Minkowski realized that relativity is really a theory about the geometrical relationship between space and time, and coined the term \""spacetime.\"" He suggested an easier way to visualize these four dimensions - by eliminating one of the dimensions, and making the vertical axis timebut in terms of length.\n\nSomething not moving spatially would be depicted as a vertical line. This is called called this a world line for the particle. \n\nA uniformly moving point would be depicted as a diagonal line on this graph because it would be moving in at least one of the spatial coordinates as it is moving forward in time. An accelerating particle would be a curved line. A light flash somewhere in this 2D space would spread in all directions with time. This forms the shape of a cone. So Minkowski called this a light cone. \n\nA light cone represents all the future events in spacetime that the light reaches from its initial event A. An upside down cone is the past light cone, and represents all the past events in spacetime that reach Event A.\n\nEvent A can be you here and now. The points outside these two light cones are causally disconnected from event A, meaning they cannot reach or be reached by event A. \n\nHow does special relativity enter affect world lines and light cones. Two observers moving relative to each other will not agree on simultaneity. Each will perceive the other's light cone as being tilted such that their observations being different can be explained. \n#minkowskispacetime\n#lightcones\n#worldlines \nWhat this shows is that simultaneity is relative to the observer. There is no absolute simultaneity in the universe. But each observer sees and experiences exactly the same spacetime. And both will agree on causality. Causality is always preserved in a universe with a finite speed of light. I will have more details on this issue of causality in a future video."",

It would be funny if you travel back in time to see a baby version of you, 20 years ago. But instead, when you jumped out of the machine, you are in the shape of a baby, just like the one you’d like to see in the first place.\n\nIn our understanding of the normal flow of time, we are actually moving from the past to the future. There are different interpretations of thisbut what people usually refer to as time travel usually means either getting to the future faster or travelling into the past. In any case, instead of the normal flow of time, we change the rate by some X amount. \n\nAccording to Newtonian mechanics, we either perceive time as linear and deterministic. But ever since Albert Einstein published the theory of relativity, the Newtonian conception of absolute time and space has been replaced by the idea that time has a subjective significance to everyone. In this case, time is one dimension of space-time in special relativity (SR). And of dynamically curved space-time in general relativity (GR).\n\nFrom here on, the possibility of moving backwards or forwards in time might not be as farfetched as one might think. In this case, it might just be as simple as how ordinary beings can move between different points in space.\n \nThere are many different hypothetical answers for time travel, and over the years, those scenarios have been put forward by notable scientists. Essentially, these scenarios are different from the notion of a physical machine with levers and dials that H.G. Wells proposed.\n\nEinstein also previously showed that time actually runs differently in different situations. This basically implies that time passes at different rates for different observers based on their travelling speed. \n \nHere’s a very interesting example. The astronauts onboard the ISS orbit the Earth at 28,000 km/h (17,500 miles/h). Taking into account the conflicting factors of GR and SR, we’ll get the net time dilation effects on the astronauts with respect to an observer on the planet’s surface.\n\nThe astronaut onboard the spaceship will get a #TimeDilation of -0.000026 seconds per day. For a typical crew member who stays on the ISS for 6 months, the total time dilation would be about 5 milliseconds. In such a case where the astronaut has a twin, the astronaut has experienced less passage of time than his twin counterpart who remained on the Earth’s surface.\n\nGiving the option to fast-forward through time is a pretty cool idea. Though it would be a one-way process where you wouldn't have the chance to go back. There might, however, be some scientific basis within the theory of relativity, supporting the possibility of time travel under certain scenarios.\n\nThere was a scientist named Kurt Gödel in the early 19th century. He showed that there are some solutions to the field equations of GR. It describes space-time so warped that they contain “closed time-like curves”. This is where an individual time-cone twists and closes in on itself. It allows a path from the present to the past or to the future. \n \nSince we're on the topic, we'll mention a few notable attempts by popular scientists on time travel.\nIn 1994, Theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre proposed a speculative scenario. This involves a spacecraft that would contract space in front of it, and expand space behind it. If this shortcut is taken, it will result in effective faster-than-light travel. You might even be able to use it for time travel.\n\nOther theoretical physicists have been thinking about these kinds of shortcuts as well. For example, Kip Thorne and Paul Davies think it's possible to use a wormhole and travel through space-time. In a similar way as GR could be used to make instantaneous spatial travel plausible."",

        ""title"": ""Is Time Travel Possible? - The Science of Time With Neil deGrasse Tyson"",
        ""description"": ""Whether time travel is possible is among the most intriguing questions in all of science. Neil deGrasse Tyson explains how time travel into the future is possible through Einstein's general relativity theory. \n\nTime travel is a widely recognized concept in philosophy and science fiction. But is it truly possible in real life? What does physics tell us about time travel? Is it possible to travel to the past? There are some physical theories that can help us learn what time travel is and how it works. Neil deGrasse Tyson explains the nature of time and the conundrums of time travel.\n\nIn Einstein's theory of special relativity time slows down or speeds up depending on how fast you move relative to something else. So, for an observer in an inertial frame of reference, a clock that is moving relative to them will be measured to tick slower than a clock that is at rest in their frame of reference. This case is sometimes called special relativistic time dilation. Time dilation may also be regarded in a limited sense as \""time travel into the future. The faster the relative velocity, the greater the time dilation between one another, with the rate of time reaching zero as one approaches the speed of light.\n\nWhile some physicists argue whether time travel is possible, theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli thinks that time is in fact illusion and our reality is just a complex network of events onto which we project sequences of past, present and future.\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson is quite possibly the most famous astrophysicist if not the most famous scientist of our time. He is a science communicator and author and he explains in layman's terms whether time travel is actually possible. Neil deGrasse Tyson has written numerous scientific books, his latest is \""Letters from an Astrophysicist\"".\n\n#TimeTravel #NeilTyson #Science\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our channel \""Science Time\"": https://www.youtube.com/sciencetime24\nSUPPORT us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sciencetime\nBUY Science Time Merch: https://teespring.com/science-time-merch\n\nSources: \nhttps://spaceplace.nasa.gov/time-travel/en/\nhttps://wiki.physics.udel.edu/AAP/Einstein's_equation_and_time_travel\nhttps://vixra.org/pdf/1504.0122v1.pdf\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/three-ways-to-travel-at-nearly-the-speed-of-light\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLKTZr00xBg&ab_channel=NeildeGrasseTysonVideos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp6cnp1kZBY&ab_channel=THG\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYkXNjn0Lqw&ab_channel=ScarlettTrantow"",

        ""title"": ""Why Going Faster-Than-Light Leads to Time Paradoxes"",
        ""description"": ""Is faster-than-light (FTL) travel possible? In most discussions of this, we get hung up on the physics of particular ideas, such as wormholes or warp drives. But today, we take a more zoomed out approach that addresses all FTL propulsion - as well as FTL messaging. Because it turns out that they all allow for time travel. Join us today as we explore why this is so and the profound consequences that ensue.\n\nWritten & presented by Prof David Kipping.

        ""description"": ""Multiverse theory suggests that our universe, which consists of billions and billions of planets, stars and galaxies and extends out tens of billions of light-years, may not be the only universe that exists. There could be another universe that is completely different from ours with its own natural laws. Even more maddeningly, there may not be just onebut an infinite number of such universes, all of which differ from one another and harbor millions of celestial bodies and even intelligent life forms, just as our universe does.\n\nMultiverse theory assumes that our universe is only a small member of an enormous composition of a multitude of universes.\n\nThe idea of multiple universes is so astounding that it has been hypothesized not only in cosmology and astronomybut also in philosophy, music, literature, science fiction, and even religion. Because of the universality of this idea, these “other\"" universes are called by different names, including parallel universes, alternative universes, parallel realities, quantum realities, alternative realities, and more.\nIn this video, we explain what exactly is the multiverse theory and what it means for humankind.\n\n\n#multiverse #science #animation\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_cosmo_infl.html\nhttps://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/observatories/satellite/wmap/inflation.html\nhttps://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/multiverse.pdf\n\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com"",

(Simplified)\n\nSubscribe for more videos:https://www.youtube.com/c/InsaneCuriosity?sub_confirmation=1?\n\nWatch Our \""Wormhole Theory Explained – Breaking Spacetime!\""\nhttps://youtu.be/hIoW-XjBhmA\n\nSo where do we start with something as big and as complicated as the Theory of Relativity? I'm sure some of you wouldn't even know what it is outside of its name, which is fine. But I'm sure you do know the man who came up with the idea, Albert Einstein. Einstein is revered as one of the smartest people to ever live, and he helped shape how we perceive both our world and our universe. So it might surprise you that this very brilliant man once started off as nothing more than a patent clerk. No, really, he did, and that's part of the origin story to the Theory of Relativity.\nBecause one day, after doing his work at the patent office, he went on a trolley car to go home. And he would do this day after day after day. This is important because while he was on that car, he would think about the universe at large. He would ask himself questions and try to figure out the answers as best he could with the information he had. And one day, he was going away from a clock tower when he asked what would happen if the car he was on was going away from the clock tower...at the speed of light.\nThis may seem like an odd question to askbut lightspeed travel is something that scientists are honestly trying to achieve right now, and these questions were truly the building blocks of this really happening. Anyway, back to the clock tower. Einstein theorized, as well as realized, that if he was moving the speed of light (which if you don't know is 299,792,458 meters per second), the hands on the clock tower (meaning the minute hand and the hour hand) would quite literally appear to stop in place.\nBut, he also knew that while he himself was traveling at the speed of light and seeing everything stop more or less, everyone who was at the clock tower, and seeing things in \""normal time\"" would not see them stop. The clock tower and its hands would keep ticking along as if nothing wrong.\nYet in this experiment, for Albert Einstein, time had literally slowed down, and it was at this moment that the \""light bulb\"" went off in his head. Because it was through this experiment that he realized that if you go faster and faster through space, you're actually causing time to go slower around you. But how was this possible if time was quite literally a constant force in the universe?\nTo try and answer this, Einstein would look to some of the other fathers of science to try and figure out the missing points in his equation. For example, he looked at the three laws of motion via Sir Isaac Newton. Newton notes that while objects do move at a certain speed, their values are never an absolute. Mainly because every speed we go at is based on a force imparted on something, or relative to something else. Such as how a car can go 65 miles per hour on a highway...but that's only because the ground and friction ALLOW it to do so. No friction on the road? You're not going that speed. Thus why he notes that every speed has to have \""in respect to\"" another force or object that is allowing or perceiving that object's speed.\nHowever, in contrast, there is James Clark Maxwell, the father of electromagnetism, who notes that of all the things in the universe, it is light that is fixed. And as noted, light goes 299,792,458 meters per second. That will never change. That speed is another constant force in the universe. Anyone, anywhere in the world, or even anywhere in the universe will be able to determine that the speed of light is the same, it won't change, and that's part of the reason why the universe works like it does, because the speed of light is constant, right?\nBut therein lies the problem, or at least, Einstein realized that this was a problem. Because Newton said that no speed in the universe could be an absolute. But then Maxwell counters this by saving the speed of light is ALWAYS a constant. Which means that these two very universal and very accepted pieces of science are at a contradiction. Which is something you never want in the world of science, trust me.\nIf you're still not getting the full picture of why this is a problem, here's another thought experiment from Einstein to help explain it.\nImagine you are at a train station, and you are standing out on the platform when a storm comes. Then, out of the blue, two lightning bolts strike on either side of you. Because of your position in the middle of these lightning bolts, you perceive them at the exact same time, and the light reaches you at that same time.\n\nTheory Of Relativity: Einstein's Twin Paradox!\nhttps://youtu.be/9APgUhdTxfg\n\n#InsaneCuriosity #Theory of Relativity #PhysicsHowTheUniverseWorks"",

        ""title"": ""What Exactly is Spacetime? Explained in Ridiculously Simple Words"",
        ""description"": ""Spacetime, as a concept, is related to a space that consists of 4 dimensions instead of the regular 3-dimensional space. As early as 1905, Einstein proposed a now widely popular theory that the speed of light is independent of the motion of all observers, and that space and time are interconnected in a single continuum. This theory, which is now a cornerstone of modern and quantum physics, is known as Einstein’s special theory of relativity. Einstein's proposed idea of a single continuum where space and time are interwoven is what people call “space-time”.\nAccording to this theory, time—which has traditionally been considered an independent entity according to the principles of classical physics—is affected when a body moves through space. This happens because, according to the theory, time and space are connected and part of a single continuum—spacetime.\nIn this video, we discuss spacetime in absolutely simple words: what exactly is spacetime and how is it related to the force of gravitation and Einstein’s theory of relativity?\n\n#science #animation #spacetime\n\n\nReferences:\nhttps://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/blueshift/index.php/2015/11/25/100-years-of-general-relativity/\nhttps://sci.esa.int/web/lisa-pathfinder/-/56434-spacetime-curvature\nhttps://sites.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/teaching/HPS_0410/chapters/Special_relativity_rel_sim/index.html\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com"",

        ""description"": ""Watch the exclusive behind the scenes on Red Bull TV 👉 https://www.redbull.com/int-en/episodes/the-ultimate-run-s1-e2\n\n“Sometimes my mind goes kind of crazy about skiing and I ask myself, what if...?” - Markus Eder\n\nWhat if you could link every powder turn, every rail, every cliff drop, every comp run and every kicker nailed into one ultimate run? Well, Markus Eder did just that in ‘The Ultimate Run’!\n\nThis is Markus’ Opus Magnum, a medley of face shots, massive tricks and even bigger drops, which was documented by Innsbruck based production company Legs of Steel over the past two years.\n\nMarkus has been visualizing the ultimate run since 2015. It may look like a simple undertaking in the final editbut for arguably the most versatile skier on the planet, it meant taking his skill levels in every form and style of contemporary freeskiing to the next level.\n\n“All aspects of freeskiing have fascinated me since the beginning”, states Markus.\n\nThe Ultimate Run kicks off on the lofty extremities of Zermatt as Markus drops into a sheer expanse of powder, before shredding his way through glacial blocks the size of buses, jumping off ice cliffs and then slips into the belly of the glacier, only to reappear above his home resort of Klausberg. Carving fields of fresh powder he joins a session with his buddies at his local snowpark, before boosting back off into the backcountry for some more face shots. The firecrackers keep on popping as he enters the snow covered architecture of Taufer castle and a mining museum. As the sun sets over the mountains Markus slides out onto the valley floor, six years of dream skiing condensed into ten minutes of pure joy and adrenaline. \n\nThis edit took over 90 days to film, entirely in the Alps in Markus’ home region. “The Ultimate Run is Markus’ dream project,” says Tobi Reindl from Legs of Steel, “and it also became one of the biggest and most thrilling projects we have done so far.”\n\nWith the first snow falling in the Alps, ‘The Ultimate Run’ is a must watch for all winter sports enthusiasts. It will reignite the passion for winter in even the most laid back snow fans for the coming season.\n\nClick play in the video above and find the answer to the question, “what if?”...\n\nFind out more about The Ultimate Run: www.redbull.com/ultimaterun\n___\nExperience the world of Red Bull Snow like you have never seen it before.

You can really see the synergy between them as artists. Hayden and Ewan really threw themselves into the roles. Their passion for the charcaters really shows.

        ""title"": ""Kobe Bryant Amazing last 3 minutes in his FINAL GAME vs Jazz (04/13/16)"",
        ""description"": ""LOS ANGELES (AP) Kobe Bryant scored 60 incredible points. He carried a miserable Los Angeles Lakers team to an improbable comeback victory.\nAnd with sweat and confetti all over his gold uniform for the final time, he expressed humble thanks to his fans and family for their loving support over two decades.\n\""What else can I say?\"" Bryant asked. \""Mamba out.\""\nNow that's a Hollywood ending to a remarkable career.\nBryant utterly dominated his final game Wednesday night, wrapping up 20 NBA seasons with one last offensive showcase in the Lakers' 101-96 victory over the Utah Jazz.\nHe scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, posting his first 50-point game since February 2009 and rallying the Lakers from a 15-point deficit to win the final game of the worst season in franchise history.\nIt was messy, ridiculous and magical - even to the man who did it so many times over 20 years.\n\""It's hard to believe it happened this way,\"" Bryant said. \""I'm still shocked about it.\""\nWith the entire Staples Center crowd standing, Bryant made a 3-pointer with 59 seconds left. He hit another with 31 seconds to play, putting the Lakers ahead 97-96. He finished with an assist before checking out for good with 4.1 seconds left in just the Lakers' 17th win of the season.\n\""The perfect ending would have been a championship,\"" Bryant said with a smile. \""But tonight was (me) trying to go out, play hard and try to put on a show as much as I possibly could. It felt good to be able to do that one last time.\""\nBryant and his teammates conspired for one last omnivorous scoring performance by the third-leading scorer in NBA history. He played 42 minutes and took a career-high 50 shots, his teammates attempting to set him up for points on nearly every possession.\nKobe came up with the fifth highest-scoring game of his career. He became the oldest player to score 50 points in an NBA game.\nThe entire night was a tribute to Bryant, who is retiring after 20 seasons, five championship rings and 18 All-Star selections with the Lakers, who honored him before and after the game. Bryant is just the fifth player in NBA history to play 20 seasons, and the first with just one team.\n\""I think the most important part is that we all stayed together throughout,\"" Bryant said to the crowd. \""You'll always be in my heart, and I sincerely, sincerely appreciate it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you guys.\""\nHe also had a few laughs after finishing his 1,346th regular-season game with 33,643 career points.\n\""The thing that had me cracking up all night long is, I go through 20 years of everybody screaming to pass the ball,\"" Bryant said with a grin. \""And then the last night, they're like, `Don't pass it!\""'\nIt was daylong tribute with thousands of fans thronging the downtown streets around Staples Center and chanting his name from early afternoon. Fans lucky enough to get inside Staples Center greeted him with ovations at every opportunity. Magic Johnson anchored a brief pregame tribute by calling Bryant \""the biggest and greatest celebrity we've had in this town for 20 years\"" and \""the greatest to wear the purple and gold.\""\nBryant embraced his roles as a hero and villain throughout his career, and he mentioned the duality in describing his outlook on sports afterward. He had rocky times in Los Angeles, from his sexual assault charge in Colorado in 2003 to his feud with Shaquille O'Neal, who watched the finale at courtside.\nIt was all forgotten by the time Bryant took the Staples court for the final time.\nAfter blowing kisses and pounding his heart before the game, Bryant got right to work on what the fans wanted to see. He didn't count on the nerves that caused him to miss his first five shots before he pump-faked and finally connected on a jumper.\nBryant found a rhythm then, finishing the first quarter with 15 points on 13 shots. He kept it up after sitting out the first six minutes of the second, finishing with 22 points despite missing a last-minute shot, his 20th of the first half.\n\""We weren't trying to let him go off on a win,\"" said Joe Ingles, who guarded Bryant closely. \""As it goes on, it will sink in more, and what he did was pretty impressive. He made some tough shots, too. I don't think we gave him any open looks. He was obviously pretty hyped up for the game. Forty-two minutes and 50 attempts will get you 60, apparently.\""\nTIP-INS\nLakers: Bryant surpassed his previous career high of 47 shots, taken in a loss to Boston on Nov. 7, 2002. ... Los Angeles has missed the playoffs in three straight seasons, the longest drought in franchise history. ... Bryant shot his 10,000th free throw to complete an early three-point play. ... Jordan Clarkson's 12 points were the second-most by the Lakers."",

        ""title"": ""Kobe Bryant Amazing last 3 minutes in his FINAL GAME vs Jazz (04/13/16)"",
        ""description"": ""LOS ANGELES (AP) Kobe Bryant scored 60 incredible points. He carried a miserable Los Angeles Lakers team to an improbable comeback victory.\nAnd with sweat and confetti all over his gold uniform for the final time, he expressed humble thanks to his fans and family for their loving support over two decades.\n\""What else can I say?\"" Bryant asked. \""Mamba out.\""\nNow that's a Hollywood ending to a remarkable career.\nBryant utterly dominated his final game Wednesday night, wrapping up 20 NBA seasons with one last offensive showcase in the Lakers' 101-96 victory over the Utah Jazz.\nHe scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, posting his first 50-point game since February 2009 and rallying the Lakers from a 15-point deficit to win the final game of the worst season in franchise history.\nIt was messy, ridiculous and magical - even to the man who did it so many times over 20 years.\n\""It's hard to believe it happened this way,\"" Bryant said. \""I'm still shocked about it.\""\nWith the entire Staples Center crowd standing, Bryant made a 3-pointer with 59 seconds left. He hit another with 31 seconds to play, putting the Lakers ahead 97-96. He finished with an assist before checking out for good with 4.1 seconds left in just the Lakers' 17th win of the season.\n\""The perfect ending would have been a championship,\"" Bryant said with a smile. \""But tonight was (me) trying to go out, play hard and try to put on a show as much as I possibly could. It felt good to be able to do that one last time.\""\nBryant and his teammates conspired for one last omnivorous scoring performance by the third-leading scorer in NBA history. He played 42 minutes and took a career-high 50 shots, his teammates attempting to set him up for points on nearly every possession.\nKobe came up with the fifth highest-scoring game of his career. He became the oldest player to score 50 points in an NBA game.\nThe entire night was a tribute to Bryant, who is retiring after 20 seasons, five championship rings and 18 All-Star selections with the Lakers, who honored him before and after the game. Bryant is just the fifth player in NBA history to play 20 seasons, and the first with just one team.\n\""I think the most important part is that we all stayed together throughout,\"" Bryant said to the crowd. \""You'll always be in my heart, and I sincerely, sincerely appreciate it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you guys.\""\nHe also had a few laughs after finishing his 1,346th regular-season game with 33,643 career points.\n\""The thing that had me cracking up all night long is, I go through 20 years of everybody screaming to pass the ball,\"" Bryant said with a grin. \""And then the last night, they're like, `Don't pass it!\""'\nIt was daylong tribute with thousands of fans thronging the downtown streets around Staples Center and chanting his name from early afternoon. Fans lucky enough to get inside Staples Center greeted him with ovations at every opportunity. Magic Johnson anchored a brief pregame tribute by calling Bryant \""the biggest and greatest celebrity we've had in this town for 20 years\"" and \""the greatest to wear the purple and gold.\""\nBryant embraced his roles as a hero and villain throughout his career, and he mentioned the duality in describing his outlook on sports afterward. He had rocky times in Los Angeles, from his sexual assault charge in Colorado in 2003 to his feud with Shaquille O'Neal, who watched the finale at courtside.\nIt was all forgotten by the time Bryant took the Staples court for the final time.\nAfter blowing kisses and pounding his heart before the game, Bryant got right to work on what the fans wanted to see. He didn't count on the nerves that caused him to miss his first five shots before he pump-faked and finally connected on a jumper.\nBryant found a rhythm then, finishing the first quarter with 15 points on 13 shots. He kept it up after sitting out the first six minutes of the second, finishing with 22 points despite missing a last-minute shot, his 20th of the first half.\n\""We weren't trying to let him go off on a win,\"" said Joe Ingles, who guarded Bryant closely. \""As it goes on, it will sink in more, and what he did was pretty impressive. He made some tough shots, too. I don't think we gave him any open looks. He was obviously pretty hyped up for the game. Forty-two minutes and 50 attempts will get you 60, apparently.\""\nTIP-INS\nLakers: Bryant surpassed his previous career high of 47 shots, taken in a loss to Boston on Nov. 7, 2002. ... Los Angeles has missed the playoffs in three straight seasons, the longest drought in franchise history. ... Bryant shot his 10,000th free throw to complete an early three-point play. ... Jordan Clarkson's 12 points were the second-most by the Lakers."",

Nosotros planteamos un reto al primer artista y éste tenía que aceptarlo y retar al siguiente a lo que quisiera: cantar, bailar, imitar o hacer cualquier disparate que se le pasara por la cabeza en ese momento.\n\nPropusimos a David Otero comenzar cantando su última canción usando solo la \""a\"" como única vocal. El artista cumplió y lanzó su reto para Willy de Taburete y éste a su vez lanzó su locura para el siguiente invitado hasta forma un reto encadenado impredecible y muy loco.\n\nLola Índigo, David Otero, Beret, Lali, Pablo Alborán, Ana Guerra, Bombai, Manuel Carrasco, Camilo, Ana Mena, Dani Fernández o David Bisbal fueron algunos de los cantantes que se dejaron la piel en el desafío de LOS40.

        ""title"": ""Kobe Bryant Amazing last 3 minutes in his FINAL GAME vs Jazz (04/13/16)"",
        ""description"": ""LOS ANGELES (AP) Kobe Bryant scored 60 incredible points. He carried a miserable Los Angeles Lakers team to an improbable comeback victory.\nAnd with sweat and confetti all over his gold uniform for the final time, he expressed humble thanks to his fans and family for their loving support over two decades.\n\""What else can I say?\"" Bryant asked. \""Mamba out.\""\nNow that's a Hollywood ending to a remarkable career.\nBryant utterly dominated his final game Wednesday night, wrapping up 20 NBA seasons with one last offensive showcase in the Lakers' 101-96 victory over the Utah Jazz.\nHe scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, posting his first 50-point game since February 2009 and rallying the Lakers from a 15-point deficit to win the final game of the worst season in franchise history.\nIt was messy, ridiculous and magical - even to the man who did it so many times over 20 years.\n\""It's hard to believe it happened this way,\"" Bryant said. \""I'm still shocked about it.\""\nWith the entire Staples Center crowd standing, Bryant made a 3-pointer with 59 seconds left. He hit another with 31 seconds to play, putting the Lakers ahead 97-96. He finished with an assist before checking out for good with 4.1 seconds left in just the Lakers' 17th win of the season.\n\""The perfect ending would have been a championship,\"" Bryant said with a smile. \""But tonight was (me) trying to go out, play hard and try to put on a show as much as I possibly could. It felt good to be able to do that one last time.\""\nBryant and his teammates conspired for one last omnivorous scoring performance by the third-leading scorer in NBA history. He played 42 minutes and took a career-high 50 shots, his teammates attempting to set him up for points on nearly every possession.\nKobe came up with the fifth highest-scoring game of his career. He became the oldest player to score 50 points in an NBA game.\nThe entire night was a tribute to Bryant, who is retiring after 20 seasons, five championship rings and 18 All-Star selections with the Lakers, who honored him before and after the game. Bryant is just the fifth player in NBA history to play 20 seasons, and the first with just one team.\n\""I think the most important part is that we all stayed together throughout,\"" Bryant said to the crowd. \""You'll always be in my heart, and I sincerely, sincerely appreciate it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you guys.\""\nHe also had a few laughs after finishing his 1,346th regular-season game with 33,643 career points.\n\""The thing that had me cracking up all night long is, I go through 20 years of everybody screaming to pass the ball,\"" Bryant said with a grin. \""And then the last night, they're like, `Don't pass it!\""'\nIt was daylong tribute with thousands of fans thronging the downtown streets around Staples Center and chanting his name from early afternoon. Fans lucky enough to get inside Staples Center greeted him with ovations at every opportunity. Magic Johnson anchored a brief pregame tribute by calling Bryant \""the biggest and greatest celebrity we've had in this town for 20 years\"" and \""the greatest to wear the purple and gold.\""\nBryant embraced his roles as a hero and villain throughout his career, and he mentioned the duality in describing his outlook on sports afterward. He had rocky times in Los Angeles, from his sexual assault charge in Colorado in 2003 to his feud with Shaquille O'Neal, who watched the finale at courtside.\nIt was all forgotten by the time Bryant took the Staples court for the final time.\nAfter blowing kisses and pounding his heart before the game, Bryant got right to work on what the fans wanted to see. He didn't count on the nerves that caused him to miss his first five shots before he pump-faked and finally connected on a jumper.\nBryant found a rhythm then, finishing the first quarter with 15 points on 13 shots. He kept it up after sitting out the first six minutes of the second, finishing with 22 points despite missing a last-minute shot, his 20th of the first half.\n\""We weren't trying to let him go off on a win,\"" said Joe Ingles, who guarded Bryant closely. \""As it goes on, it will sink in more, and what he did was pretty impressive. He made some tough shots, too. I don't think we gave him any open looks. He was obviously pretty hyped up for the game. Forty-two minutes and 50 attempts will get you 60, apparently.\""\nTIP-INS\nLakers: Bryant surpassed his previous career high of 47 shots, taken in a loss to Boston on Nov. 7, 2002. ... Los Angeles has missed the playoffs in three straight seasons, the longest drought in franchise history. ... Bryant shot his 10,000th free throw to complete an early three-point play. ... Jordan Clarkson's 12 points were the second-most by the Lakers."",

She emerged from the shadows of her brothers -- who were also part of the successful Jackson 5 in the 70s -- and forged an image and successful music career all her own.\n\nEven when her brother Michael Jackson became a global superstar, Janet still held her own, and albums like Janet and The Velvet Rope became her signature works, also cementing her place as a sex symbol.\n\nJanet has had her ups and downs throughout her storied career but she somehow manages to push it aside and reinvent herself every time. And now, her recent new look is turning heads again.\n\n#JanetJackson #Transformation #Music\n\nHumble beginnings | 0:00\nShedding that good girl image | 1:01\nConfronting her demons | 1:38\nAdvocating for the LGBT community | 2:41\nMTV's first-ever icon | 3:36\nThe infamous wardrobe malfunction | 4:17\nHonoring Michael | 5:36\nRevealing her struggles | 6:22\nPaying it forward | 7:07\nLaunching her record label | 7:52\nBecoming a mother | 8:36\nCrushing that body | 9:21\nTaking a stand for equality | 10:36\nPutting in the work | 11:25\n\nRead Full Article: https://www.thelist.com/69370/stunning-transformation-janet-jackson/"",
