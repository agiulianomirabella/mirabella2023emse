        ""title"": ""Kobe Bryant Amazing last 3 minutes in his FINAL GAME vs Jazz (04/13/16)"",
        ""description"": ""LOS ANGELES (AP) Kobe Bryant scored 60 incredible points. He carried a miserable Los Angeles Lakers team to an improbable comeback victory.\nAnd with sweat and confetti all over his gold uniform for the final time, he expressed humble thanks to his fans and family for their loving support over two decades.\n\""What else can I say?\"" Bryant asked. \""Mamba out.\""\nNow that's a Hollywood ending to a remarkable career.\nBryant utterly dominated his final game Wednesday night, wrapping up 20 NBA seasons with one last offensive showcase in the Lakers' 101-96 victory over the Utah Jazz.\nHe scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, posting his first 50-point game since February 2009 and rallying the Lakers from a 15-point deficit to win the final game of the worst season in franchise history.\nIt was messy, ridiculous and magical - even to the man who did it so many times over 20 years.\n\""It's hard to believe it happened this way,\"" Bryant said. \""I'm still shocked about it.\""\nWith the entire Staples Center crowd standing, Bryant made a 3-pointer with 59 seconds left. He hit another with 31 seconds to play, putting the Lakers ahead 97-96. He finished with an assist before checking out for good with 4.1 seconds left in just the Lakers' 17th win of the season.\n\""The perfect ending would have been a championship,\"" Bryant said with a smile. \""But tonight was (me) trying to go out, play hard and try to put on a show as much as I possibly could. It felt good to be able to do that one last time.\""\nBryant and his teammates conspired for one last omnivorous scoring performance by the third-leading scorer in NBA history. He played 42 minutes and took a career-high 50 shots, his teammates attempting to set him up for points on nearly every possession.\nKobe came up with the fifth highest-scoring game of his career. He became the oldest player to score 50 points in an NBA game.\nThe entire night was a tribute to Bryant, who is retiring after 20 seasons, five championship rings and 18 All-Star selections with the Lakers, who honored him before and after the game. Bryant is just the fifth player in NBA history to play 20 seasons, and the first with just one team.\n\""I think the most important part is that we all stayed together throughout,\"" Bryant said to the crowd. \""You'll always be in my heart, and I sincerely, sincerely appreciate it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you guys.\""\nHe also had a few laughs after finishing his 1,346th regular-season game with 33,643 career points.\n\""The thing that had me cracking up all night long is, I go through 20 years of everybody screaming to pass the ball,\"" Bryant said with a grin. \""And then the last night, they're like, `Don't pass it!\""'\nIt was daylong tribute with thousands of fans thronging the downtown streets around Staples Center and chanting his name from early afternoon. Fans lucky enough to get inside Staples Center greeted him with ovations at every opportunity. Magic Johnson anchored a brief pregame tribute by calling Bryant \""the biggest and greatest celebrity we've had in this town for 20 years\"" and \""the greatest to wear the purple and gold.\""\nBryant embraced his roles as a hero and villain throughout his career, and he mentioned the duality in describing his outlook on sports afterward. He had rocky times in Los Angeles, from his sexual assault charge in Colorado in 2003 to his feud with Shaquille O'Neal, who watched the finale at courtside.\nIt was all forgotten by the time Bryant took the Staples court for the final time.\nAfter blowing kisses and pounding his heart before the game, Bryant got right to work on what the fans wanted to see. He didn't count on the nerves that caused him to miss his first five shots before he pump-faked and finally connected on a jumper.\nBryant found a rhythm then, finishing the first quarter with 15 points on 13 shots. He kept it up after sitting out the first six minutes of the second, finishing with 22 points despite missing a last-minute shot, his 20th of the first half.\n\""We weren't trying to let him go off on a win,\"" said Joe Ingles, who guarded Bryant closely. \""As it goes on, it will sink in more, and what he did was pretty impressive. He made some tough shots, too. I don't think we gave him any open looks. He was obviously pretty hyped up for the game. Forty-two minutes and 50 attempts will get you 60, apparently.\""\nTIP-INS\nLakers: Bryant surpassed his previous career high of 47 shots, taken in a loss to Boston on Nov. 7, 2002. ... Los Angeles has missed the playoffs in three straight seasons, the longest drought in franchise history. ... Bryant shot his 10,000th free throw to complete an early three-point play. ... Jordan Clarkson's 12 points were the second-most by the Lakers."",

        ""description"": ""[TL;DR - Every lightsaber duel in all first 6 major Star Wars films. YouTube is blocking me from adding EP 7-9]\n\nA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...\n\nSTAR WARS\n\n-Lightsaber Duels-\n\nIt is a more civilized age with more civilized weapons. The Jedi seek to overthrow the Galactic Empire and they use their lightsabers to do it. And some force stuff. And then after thatbut before it somehow, we see the evil Emperor come to power through more intense, longer lightsaber battles.\n\nEach Episode of the Star Wars saga features a number of lightsaber battles; but, let's be honest, we just want to watch people fight with these things and hope someone's hand gets cut off, or maybe even see a decapitation.\n\nWell, here they are; every lightsaber duel in Star Wars without the cutaways, dialog or any other non-sense that gets in the way of good old fashioned saber-dueling. These fights are shown in their original theatrical order as they grow in length, number and and intensity in each film. The Jedi were on there way to do something kind of important and then this happened...\n\n\n-May the 4th be with you-"",

        ""title"": ""Kobe Bryant Amazing last 3 minutes in his FINAL GAME vs Jazz (04/13/16)"",
        ""description"": ""LOS ANGELES (AP) Kobe Bryant scored 60 incredible points. He carried a miserable Los Angeles Lakers team to an improbable comeback victory.\nAnd with sweat and confetti all over his gold uniform for the final time, he expressed humble thanks to his fans and family for their loving support over two decades.\n\""What else can I say?\"" Bryant asked. \""Mamba out.\""\nNow that's a Hollywood ending to a remarkable career.\nBryant utterly dominated his final game Wednesday night, wrapping up 20 NBA seasons with one last offensive showcase in the Lakers' 101-96 victory over the Utah Jazz.\nHe scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, posting his first 50-point game since February 2009 and rallying the Lakers from a 15-point deficit to win the final game of the worst season in franchise history.\nIt was messy, ridiculous and magical - even to the man who did it so many times over 20 years.\n\""It's hard to believe it happened this way,\"" Bryant said. \""I'm still shocked about it.\""\nWith the entire Staples Center crowd standing, Bryant made a 3-pointer with 59 seconds left. He hit another with 31 seconds to play, putting the Lakers ahead 97-96. He finished with an assist before checking out for good with 4.1 seconds left in just the Lakers' 17th win of the season.\n\""The perfect ending would have been a championship,\"" Bryant said with a smile. \""But tonight was (me) trying to go out, play hard and try to put on a show as much as I possibly could. It felt good to be able to do that one last time.\""\nBryant and his teammates conspired for one last omnivorous scoring performance by the third-leading scorer in NBA history. He played 42 minutes and took a career-high 50 shots, his teammates attempting to set him up for points on nearly every possession.\nKobe came up with the fifth highest-scoring game of his career. He became the oldest player to score 50 points in an NBA game.\nThe entire night was a tribute to Bryant, who is retiring after 20 seasons, five championship rings and 18 All-Star selections with the Lakers, who honored him before and after the game. Bryant is just the fifth player in NBA history to play 20 seasons, and the first with just one team.\n\""I think the most important part is that we all stayed together throughout,\"" Bryant said to the crowd. \""You'll always be in my heart, and I sincerely, sincerely appreciate it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you guys.\""\nHe also had a few laughs after finishing his 1,346th regular-season game with 33,643 career points.\n\""The thing that had me cracking up all night long is, I go through 20 years of everybody screaming to pass the ball,\"" Bryant said with a grin. \""And then the last night, they're like, `Don't pass it!\""'\nIt was daylong tribute with thousands of fans thronging the downtown streets around Staples Center and chanting his name from early afternoon. Fans lucky enough to get inside Staples Center greeted him with ovations at every opportunity. Magic Johnson anchored a brief pregame tribute by calling Bryant \""the biggest and greatest celebrity we've had in this town for 20 years\"" and \""the greatest to wear the purple and gold.\""\nBryant embraced his roles as a hero and villain throughout his career, and he mentioned the duality in describing his outlook on sports afterward. He had rocky times in Los Angeles, from his sexual assault charge in Colorado in 2003 to his feud with Shaquille O'Neal, who watched the finale at courtside.\nIt was all forgotten by the time Bryant took the Staples court for the final time.\nAfter blowing kisses and pounding his heart before the game, Bryant got right to work on what the fans wanted to see. He didn't count on the nerves that caused him to miss his first five shots before he pump-faked and finally connected on a jumper.\nBryant found a rhythm then, finishing the first quarter with 15 points on 13 shots. He kept it up after sitting out the first six minutes of the second, finishing with 22 points despite missing a last-minute shot, his 20th of the first half.\n\""We weren't trying to let him go off on a win,\"" said Joe Ingles, who guarded Bryant closely. \""As it goes on, it will sink in more, and what he did was pretty impressive. He made some tough shots, too. I don't think we gave him any open looks. He was obviously pretty hyped up for the game. Forty-two minutes and 50 attempts will get you 60, apparently.\""\nTIP-INS\nLakers: Bryant surpassed his previous career high of 47 shots, taken in a loss to Boston on Nov. 7, 2002. ... Los Angeles has missed the playoffs in three straight seasons, the longest drought in franchise history. ... Bryant shot his 10,000th free throw to complete an early three-point play. ... Jordan Clarkson's 12 points were the second-most by the Lakers."",

        ""title"": ""Kobe Bryant Amazing last 3 minutes in his FINAL GAME vs Jazz (04/13/16)"",
        ""description"": ""LOS ANGELES (AP) Kobe Bryant scored 60 incredible points. He carried a miserable Los Angeles Lakers team to an improbable comeback victory.\nAnd with sweat and confetti all over his gold uniform for the final time, he expressed humble thanks to his fans and family for their loving support over two decades.\n\""What else can I say?\"" Bryant asked. \""Mamba out.\""\nNow that's a Hollywood ending to a remarkable career.\nBryant utterly dominated his final game Wednesday night, wrapping up 20 NBA seasons with one last offensive showcase in the Lakers' 101-96 victory over the Utah Jazz.\nHe scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, posting his first 50-point game since February 2009 and rallying the Lakers from a 15-point deficit to win the final game of the worst season in franchise history.\nIt was messy, ridiculous and magical - even to the man who did it so many times over 20 years.\n\""It's hard to believe it happened this way,\"" Bryant said. \""I'm still shocked about it.\""\nWith the entire Staples Center crowd standing, Bryant made a 3-pointer with 59 seconds left. He hit another with 31 seconds to play, putting the Lakers ahead 97-96. He finished with an assist before checking out for good with 4.1 seconds left in just the Lakers' 17th win of the season.\n\""The perfect ending would have been a championship,\"" Bryant said with a smile. \""But tonight was (me) trying to go out, play hard and try to put on a show as much as I possibly could. It felt good to be able to do that one last time.\""\nBryant and his teammates conspired for one last omnivorous scoring performance by the third-leading scorer in NBA history. He played 42 minutes and took a career-high 50 shots, his teammates attempting to set him up for points on nearly every possession.\nKobe came up with the fifth highest-scoring game of his career. He became the oldest player to score 50 points in an NBA game.\nThe entire night was a tribute to Bryant, who is retiring after 20 seasons, five championship rings and 18 All-Star selections with the Lakers, who honored him before and after the game. Bryant is just the fifth player in NBA history to play 20 seasons, and the first with just one team.\n\""I think the most important part is that we all stayed together throughout,\"" Bryant said to the crowd. \""You'll always be in my heart, and I sincerely, sincerely appreciate it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you guys.\""\nHe also had a few laughs after finishing his 1,346th regular-season game with 33,643 career points.\n\""The thing that had me cracking up all night long is, I go through 20 years of everybody screaming to pass the ball,\"" Bryant said with a grin. \""And then the last night, they're like, `Don't pass it!\""'\nIt was daylong tribute with thousands of fans thronging the downtown streets around Staples Center and chanting his name from early afternoon. Fans lucky enough to get inside Staples Center greeted him with ovations at every opportunity. Magic Johnson anchored a brief pregame tribute by calling Bryant \""the biggest and greatest celebrity we've had in this town for 20 years\"" and \""the greatest to wear the purple and gold.\""\nBryant embraced his roles as a hero and villain throughout his career, and he mentioned the duality in describing his outlook on sports afterward. He had rocky times in Los Angeles, from his sexual assault charge in Colorado in 2003 to his feud with Shaquille O'Neal, who watched the finale at courtside.\nIt was all forgotten by the time Bryant took the Staples court for the final time.\nAfter blowing kisses and pounding his heart before the game, Bryant got right to work on what the fans wanted to see. He didn't count on the nerves that caused him to miss his first five shots before he pump-faked and finally connected on a jumper.\nBryant found a rhythm then, finishing the first quarter with 15 points on 13 shots. He kept it up after sitting out the first six minutes of the second, finishing with 22 points despite missing a last-minute shot, his 20th of the first half.\n\""We weren't trying to let him go off on a win,\"" said Joe Ingles, who guarded Bryant closely. \""As it goes on, it will sink in more, and what he did was pretty impressive. He made some tough shots, too. I don't think we gave him any open looks. He was obviously pretty hyped up for the game. Forty-two minutes and 50 attempts will get you 60, apparently.\""\nTIP-INS\nLakers: Bryant surpassed his previous career high of 47 shots, taken in a loss to Boston on Nov. 7, 2002. ... Los Angeles has missed the playoffs in three straight seasons, the longest drought in franchise history. ... Bryant shot his 10,000th free throw to complete an early three-point play. ... Jordan Clarkson's 12 points were the second-most by the Lakers."",

People thought it was just too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn’t satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.\n\nHe imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer’s perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the groundbut since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. \n\nIn a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. \n\nEinstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference\n\nHe imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. \n\nHowever, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can’t be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. \n\nThis was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.\n\nIt’s important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes onlybut it is really in 3D.  \n\nIn order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury’s orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. \n\nBut many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. \n#generalrelativity\n#einstein\nWhy is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. \n\nGeneral relativity does not answer everything. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn’t really tell us what exactly it is."",

        ""description"": ""A circle is 360 degrees But have you ever thought why is a circle not a simpler number, like 10 degrees or 100 degrees? As it turns out 360 is actually a very good number. From a purely mathematical standpoint, a number like 10 or 100 would have been more inconvenient.\n\nYou see, the number 360 is divisible by every number from 1 to 10, aside from 7. In addition to that, 360 has 24 divisors. This is the highest number of divisors for any positive whole number up to its own value of 360. This is just one of the reasons why a circle is 360 degrees. \n\nIn this video, we have discussed some other reasons that make 360 an idea number for calculations.\n\n#circle #geometry #mathematics\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/scienceabcofficial/ \n\nFollow us on LinkedIn!\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/scienceabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com"",

        ""title"": ""Kobe Bryant Amazing last 3 minutes in his FINAL GAME vs Jazz (04/13/16)"",
        ""description"": ""LOS ANGELES (AP) Kobe Bryant scored 60 incredible points. He carried a miserable Los Angeles Lakers team to an improbable comeback victory.\nAnd with sweat and confetti all over his gold uniform for the final time, he expressed humble thanks to his fans and family for their loving support over two decades.\n\""What else can I say?\"" Bryant asked. \""Mamba out.\""\nNow that's a Hollywood ending to a remarkable career.\nBryant utterly dominated his final game Wednesday night, wrapping up 20 NBA seasons with one last offensive showcase in the Lakers' 101-96 victory over the Utah Jazz.\nHe scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, posting his first 50-point game since February 2009 and rallying the Lakers from a 15-point deficit to win the final game of the worst season in franchise history.\nIt was messy, ridiculous and magical - even to the man who did it so many times over 20 years.\n\""It's hard to believe it happened this way,\"" Bryant said. \""I'm still shocked about it.\""\nWith the entire Staples Center crowd standing, Bryant made a 3-pointer with 59 seconds left. He hit another with 31 seconds to play, putting the Lakers ahead 97-96. He finished with an assist before checking out for good with 4.1 seconds left in just the Lakers' 17th win of the season.\n\""The perfect ending would have been a championship,\"" Bryant said with a smile. \""But tonight was (me) trying to go out, play hard and try to put on a show as much as I possibly could. It felt good to be able to do that one last time.\""\nBryant and his teammates conspired for one last omnivorous scoring performance by the third-leading scorer in NBA history. He played 42 minutes and took a career-high 50 shots, his teammates attempting to set him up for points on nearly every possession.\nKobe came up with the fifth highest-scoring game of his career. He became the oldest player to score 50 points in an NBA game.\nThe entire night was a tribute to Bryant, who is retiring after 20 seasons, five championship rings and 18 All-Star selections with the Lakers, who honored him before and after the game. Bryant is just the fifth player in NBA history to play 20 seasons, and the first with just one team.\n\""I think the most important part is that we all stayed together throughout,\"" Bryant said to the crowd. \""You'll always be in my heart, and I sincerely, sincerely appreciate it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you guys.\""\nHe also had a few laughs after finishing his 1,346th regular-season game with 33,643 career points.\n\""The thing that had me cracking up all night long is, I go through 20 years of everybody screaming to pass the ball,\"" Bryant said with a grin. \""And then the last night, they're like, `Don't pass it!\""'\nIt was daylong tribute with thousands of fans thronging the downtown streets around Staples Center and chanting his name from early afternoon. Fans lucky enough to get inside Staples Center greeted him with ovations at every opportunity. Magic Johnson anchored a brief pregame tribute by calling Bryant \""the biggest and greatest celebrity we've had in this town for 20 years\"" and \""the greatest to wear the purple and gold.\""\nBryant embraced his roles as a hero and villain throughout his career, and he mentioned the duality in describing his outlook on sports afterward. He had rocky times in Los Angeles, from his sexual assault charge in Colorado in 2003 to his feud with Shaquille O'Neal, who watched the finale at courtside.\nIt was all forgotten by the time Bryant took the Staples court for the final time.\nAfter blowing kisses and pounding his heart before the game, Bryant got right to work on what the fans wanted to see. He didn't count on the nerves that caused him to miss his first five shots before he pump-faked and finally connected on a jumper.\nBryant found a rhythm then, finishing the first quarter with 15 points on 13 shots. He kept it up after sitting out the first six minutes of the second, finishing with 22 points despite missing a last-minute shot, his 20th of the first half.\n\""We weren't trying to let him go off on a win,\"" said Joe Ingles, who guarded Bryant closely. \""As it goes on, it will sink in more, and what he did was pretty impressive. He made some tough shots, too. I don't think we gave him any open looks. He was obviously pretty hyped up for the game. Forty-two minutes and 50 attempts will get you 60, apparently.\""\nTIP-INS\nLakers: Bryant surpassed his previous career high of 47 shots, taken in a loss to Boston on Nov. 7, 2002. ... Los Angeles has missed the playoffs in three straight seasons, the longest drought in franchise history. ... Bryant shot his 10,000th free throw to complete an early three-point play. ... Jordan Clarkson's 12 points were the second-most by the Lakers."",

        ""title"": ""Kobe Bryant Amazing last 3 minutes in his FINAL GAME vs Jazz (04/13/16)"",
        ""description"": ""LOS ANGELES (AP) Kobe Bryant scored 60 incredible points. He carried a miserable Los Angeles Lakers team to an improbable comeback victory.\nAnd with sweat and confetti all over his gold uniform for the final time, he expressed humble thanks to his fans and family for their loving support over two decades.\n\""What else can I say?\"" Bryant asked. \""Mamba out.\""\nNow that's a Hollywood ending to a remarkable career.\nBryant utterly dominated his final game Wednesday night, wrapping up 20 NBA seasons with one last offensive showcase in the Lakers' 101-96 victory over the Utah Jazz.\nHe scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, posting his first 50-point game since February 2009 and rallying the Lakers from a 15-point deficit to win the final game of the worst season in franchise history.\nIt was messy, ridiculous and magical - even to the man who did it so many times over 20 years.\n\""It's hard to believe it happened this way,\"" Bryant said. \""I'm still shocked about it.\""\nWith the entire Staples Center crowd standing, Bryant made a 3-pointer with 59 seconds left. He hit another with 31 seconds to play, putting the Lakers ahead 97-96. He finished with an assist before checking out for good with 4.1 seconds left in just the Lakers' 17th win of the season.\n\""The perfect ending would have been a championship,\"" Bryant said with a smile. \""But tonight was (me) trying to go out, play hard and try to put on a show as much as I possibly could. It felt good to be able to do that one last time.\""\nBryant and his teammates conspired for one last omnivorous scoring performance by the third-leading scorer in NBA history. He played 42 minutes and took a career-high 50 shots, his teammates attempting to set him up for points on nearly every possession.\nKobe came up with the fifth highest-scoring game of his career. He became the oldest player to score 50 points in an NBA game.\nThe entire night was a tribute to Bryant, who is retiring after 20 seasons, five championship rings and 18 All-Star selections with the Lakers, who honored him before and after the game. Bryant is just the fifth player in NBA history to play 20 seasons, and the first with just one team.\n\""I think the most important part is that we all stayed together throughout,\"" Bryant said to the crowd. \""You'll always be in my heart, and I sincerely, sincerely appreciate it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I love you guys.\""\nHe also had a few laughs after finishing his 1,346th regular-season game with 33,643 career points.\n\""The thing that had me cracking up all night long is, I go through 20 years of everybody screaming to pass the ball,\"" Bryant said with a grin. \""And then the last night, they're like, `Don't pass it!\""'\nIt was daylong tribute with thousands of fans thronging the downtown streets around Staples Center and chanting his name from early afternoon. Fans lucky enough to get inside Staples Center greeted him with ovations at every opportunity. Magic Johnson anchored a brief pregame tribute by calling Bryant \""the biggest and greatest celebrity we've had in this town for 20 years\"" and \""the greatest to wear the purple and gold.\""\nBryant embraced his roles as a hero and villain throughout his career, and he mentioned the duality in describing his outlook on sports afterward. He had rocky times in Los Angeles, from his sexual assault charge in Colorado in 2003 to his feud with Shaquille O'Neal, who watched the finale at courtside.\nIt was all forgotten by the time Bryant took the Staples court for the final time.\nAfter blowing kisses and pounding his heart before the game, Bryant got right to work on what the fans wanted to see. He didn't count on the nerves that caused him to miss his first five shots before he pump-faked and finally connected on a jumper.\nBryant found a rhythm then, finishing the first quarter with 15 points on 13 shots. He kept it up after sitting out the first six minutes of the second, finishing with 22 points despite missing a last-minute shot, his 20th of the first half.\n\""We weren't trying to let him go off on a win,\"" said Joe Ingles, who guarded Bryant closely. \""As it goes on, it will sink in more, and what he did was pretty impressive. He made some tough shots, too. I don't think we gave him any open looks. He was obviously pretty hyped up for the game. Forty-two minutes and 50 attempts will get you 60, apparently.\""\nTIP-INS\nLakers: Bryant surpassed his previous career high of 47 shots, taken in a loss to Boston on Nov. 7, 2002. ... Los Angeles has missed the playoffs in three straight seasons, the longest drought in franchise history. ... Bryant shot his 10,000th free throw to complete an early three-point play. ... Jordan Clarkson's 12 points were the second-most by the Lakers."",
