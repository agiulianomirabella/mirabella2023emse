People thought it was just too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn’t satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.\n\nHe imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer’s perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the groundbut since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. \n\nIn a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. \n\nEinstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference\n\nHe imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. \n\nHowever, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can’t be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. \n\nThis was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.\n\nIt’s important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes onlybut it is really in 3D.  \n\nIn order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury’s orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. \n\nBut many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. \n#generalrelativity\n#einstein\nWhy is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. \n\nGeneral relativity does not answer everything. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn’t really tell us what exactly it is."",

        ""title"": ""The Science of Extreme Time Dilation in Interstellar"",
        ""description"": ""For every one hour on Miller's planet, time elapses roughly 7 years on Earth. How is that possible? In this fun video, we'll explore the science behind #Time #Dilation.\nWatch part 2 of the Interstellar series: https://youtu.be/ML7mh_2_MUE\n\nVisit https://brilliant.org/BeeyondIdeas/ to get started learning STEM for free.

You can check out the video herebut just to give you a brief summary, we can say the following.\nUnder the influence of a strong gravitational field, time slows down. So if you’re just hanging out near a massive object, you will experience the effect of time going slower.  \n\nBut gravity isn’t the only thing that can warp time. According to another one of Einstein's theories, special relativity, time slows down for an object when it moves. Combining these two concepts together, we could consider this scenario.\n\nSuppose that we walk up a flight of stairs. Our body is slowly moved away from earth, meaning that we will experience time going faster. But at the same time, since we are not stationary while going up, we should experience time going slower. So being farther from the pull of Earth's gravity causes our clock to tick fasterbut moving “counteracts” this effect. Of course, this is all oversimplified.\n\nLet’s consider two comparable cases. We have person A, floating nearby a massive object with a lot of gravity. And person B, just casually floating in an empty void of space. \nPerson A shines a green laser beam toward person B. Because light is a form of vibration, the laser beam has a color that corresponds to 600 trillion vib/s. Now light is also a form of energy, and as that beam of light comes out of that gravity of the massive object, it loses a lot of energy. This loss means that there’s a decrease in frequency. \n\nSo, by the time that beam of light reaches person B, its frequency will have decreased by some factor. That means that instead of the green light, at six hundred trillion vibrations a sec, person B gets only.. let’s say 10 billion vib/s. Which is a microwave radio beam. This phenomenon is called the gravitational redshift.\n\nIndividual wiggles don't just go anywhere and disappear. Since person A creates 600 trillion wiggles every sec, while person B only gets 10 billion every second, the only way this can happen is if one second on one astronaut’s clock is not the same as one second on the other astronaut.\n\nIn other words, it only takes one sec for person A to create those 600 trillion wigglesbut it will take 60,000 seconds, or nearly a day, for person B to receive them. So this is what happens. Our clocks run at wildly different rates. And by \""clocks\"" I don't just mean mechanical or electronic devicesbut also biological clocks, like your heart, your lungs, your brain, etc. \n\nPerson A takes a breath, takes another breath, and measures a few seconds between the two. For him, everything feels normal. Clocks tick the way they are supposed to. On the other hand person B, watching person A through a telescope, sees everything in slow motion, with several days passing between the two breaths.\n\nSo now revisiting this scene again from #Interstellar, you should get a better understanding as to why Cooper says he will be the same age as his daughter by the time he comes back from the mission.\n\nAccording to Einstein’s special relativity, the greater the acceleration of an object, the slower it will move through time. On Earth, where time is slowed by only a few microseconds per day, gravity’s pull is modest. And at the surface of a black hole, time is slowed to a halt, where the gravity is so humongous that nothing can escape.\n\nIn the movie, Miller’s planet is depicted to be present in the warped space, very close to a black hole Gargantua. Gravity’s pull on Miller’s planet is enormous. So if we apply Einstein’s relativity here, we would know that Miller’s planet would experience time at a very slow rate. But here on Earth, gravity is at a modest rate. And the gravitational force of the sun is also a billion times weaker than Gargantua. So people on Earth “experience time” faster than that of the three astronauts on Miller’s planet."",

Terra will remain on Earth, while Stella will board a spaceship. Stella’s ship will travel to visit a star that is 10 light-years away, then return to Earth. As they prepare to part ways, the twins wonder what will happen when they’re reunited. Who will be older? Amber Stuver investigates the “Twin Paradox.”\n\nLesson by Amber Stuver, directed by Aim Creative Studios.\n\nSign up for our newsletter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdNewsletter\nSupport us on Patreon: http://bit.ly/TEDEdPatreon\nFollow us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/TEDEdFacebook\nFind us on Twitter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdTwitter\nPeep us on Instagram: http://bit.ly/TEDEdInstagram\nView full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/einstein-s-twin-paradox-explained-amber-l-stuver\n\nThank you so much to our patrons for your support!

But Tesla also had an eidetic memory and could memorize entire books after reading them once, while Einstein had to study hard to remember facts for tests at school. Tesla had an IQ of 187, which is considered “gifted” by psychologists’ standards . Einstein, by comparison, had an IQ of 160, which is considered \""genius\"" but not nearly as high as Tesla’s.  The two great minds were friends and colleagues at the beginning of their careersbut the relationship turned sour when they disagreed over whether or not light has mass. Tesla believed it did , while Einstein held that it didn’t . They continued to argue over this for years, until one day Tesla finally decided to settle it once and for all: he challenged Einstein to a game of chess! If Einstein won, Tesla would have to come around to his way of thinking about light; if Tesla won… well… we’ll get to that later.\nEinstein accepted the challenge, and they began playing in a coffee shop on New York City’s Lexington Avenue in front of witnesses who had gathered around to watch history being made. After just five moves by each player , Einstein realized he didn’t stand a chance against his friend’s superior strategy and conceded defeat.\n\n📺 Watch the entire video for more information!\n\n#nikolatesla #nikolatesla369 #nikolatesladocumentary\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nAbout Neuro Sign\n🎥 Videos about Nikola Tesla\n🎨 Written, voiced and produced by Neuro Sign\n🔔 Subscribe now for more Nikola Tesla videos\n\nWatch More from Neuro Sign\n🟢 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKJnMSz4d9Nat71Gav1xTHg/\n_____________________________________________________\n\n💼 Business Inquiries and Contact\n• For business inquiries, copyright matters or other inquiries please contact us at: neurosignyt@gmail.com\n\n❓ Copyright Questions\n• If you have any copyright questions or issues you can contact us at neurosignyt@gmail.com\n\n⚠️ Copyright Disclaimers\n• We use images and content in accordance with the YouTube Fair Use copyright guidelines\n• Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act states: “Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.” \n• This video could contain certain copyrighted video clips, pictures, or photographs that were not specifically authorized to be used by the copyright holder(s)but which we believe in good faith are protected by federal law and the fair use doctrine for one or more of the reasons noted above."",

        ""title"": ""Special Relativity simplified using no math. Einstein thought experiments"",
        ""description"": ""Einstein's Special Relativity Explained Simply - no math\n\nThis entire revolution in physics started with a simple thought experiments, in the prolific imagination before Einstein even graduated from high school.  Einstein’s theory of special relativity is convention today. But to understand how revolutionary it was for its time, it is helpful to look at what the conventional understanding of physics was during the time of Einstein’s teenage years.\n\nIn 1801, Thomas Young had conducted a simple double slit experiment that showed that light behaved like a wave. So the  theory about light at the time was that it was a wave.  The problem is that a wave, it was thought, had to move through some sort of medium. They called this substance the luminiferous aether.  \n\nBut in 1887, two scientists by the name of Albert Michelson and Edward Morely came up with an idea to test the existence of the aether. The background ether was believed to be unmoving and static, so if the wave was traveling in the same direction as the earth, the speed of the wave should be higher in the direction of the speed of the earth. Michelson and Morley showed that there was no difference in the speed of light of the two measurements. This seriously jeopardized the aether theory.  \n\nEinstein knew this, so he came up with a thought experiment as a 16 year old.  His thought was to imagine that he was chasing a beam of light while traveling at the speed of light himself.  What would he see? If young Albert could catch up to the beam, he should see a stationary wave.\n\nYet that was impossible. Einstein knew such stationary fields would violate the equations of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk Maxwell 20 years earlier. \n\nSo he came up with two postulates, and tried to figure out what the physics would be if the two postulates were true.\nPostulate 1 was that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial reference frames. \nPostulate 2 was that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all inertial reference frames.  \n\nThe first postulate had been assumed for hundreds of years. The second postulate, however, was the revolution. \n\nThis meant that young Einstein would never see the stationary, oscillating fields, because he could never catch the light beam.\nBut this solution seemed to have fatal flaw. Einstein later explained the problem with another thought experiment: \n\nImagine firing a light beam along a railroad embankment just as a train roars by in the same direction at, say, 2,000 miles a second. Someone standing on the embankment would measure the light beam’s speed to be the standard number, 186,000 miles a second. But someone on the train would see it moving past at only 184,000 miles a second. \n\nIf the speed of light was not constant, Maxwell’s equations would somehow have to look different inside the railcar, and the first postulate would be violated. The solution to his thought experiment was that observers in relative motion experience time differently. This completely overturned hundreds of years of classical physics in which time was absolute in the universe.  Einstein showed that time is relative, and varies in different frames of reference. The idea of the aether was no longer needed. \n   \nThis one realization that reality is not the same for different frames of reference also led to other implications of special relativity:\nThat Fast moving object appear shorter\nThat Fast moving objects appears to have increased mass \nAnd finally, the most famous equation in science E=MC2\nThat mass and energy are equivalent.\n\nSo, how did Einstein come up with his most famous equation based on his original two postulates? Let’s look at this conceptually.  \n\nIf conservation of mass is interpreted as conservation of rest mass, this did not hold true in special relativity. Since different observers would disagree about what the energy of a system was, the mass and energy taken together must be conserved, not just the mass on its own. \n\nIt turns out that for the laws of physics, namely conservation of energy and momentum, to be consistent in the two \""reference frames\"" of two observers moving with respect to each other, there has to be an energy associated with a body at rest, not just a body in motion. And that is what E=MC2 implies – the M in the equation is the mass at rest.  \n\nSome people point out that much of the actual work for special relativity had already been done by the time Einstein presented it. The concepts of time dilation for moving objects, were already in place and the mathematics had already been developed by Lorentz & Poincare. Einstein still deserves the accolades because he rejected the idea of the ether all together which other scientists had not done, and the idea of mass and energy equivalence via E=MC2 is solely Einstein. Scientists who had done prior work like Thomson, Larmor, Lorentz, or Poincare had never implied such a bold proposition. \n\n#specialrelativity\n#einstein\n#michelsonmorley"",

Nosotros planteamos un reto al primer artista y éste tenía que aceptarlo y retar al siguiente a lo que quisiera: cantar, bailar, imitar o hacer cualquier disparate que se le pasara por la cabeza en ese momento.\n\nPropusimos a David Otero comenzar cantando su última canción usando solo la \""a\"" como única vocal. El artista cumplió y lanzó su reto para Willy de Taburete y éste a su vez lanzó su locura para el siguiente invitado hasta forma un reto encadenado impredecible y muy loco.\n\nLola Índigo, David Otero, Beret, Lali, Pablo Alborán, Ana Guerra, Bombai, Manuel Carrasco, Camilo, Ana Mena, Dani Fernández o David Bisbal fueron algunos de los cantantes que se dejaron la piel en el desafío de LOS40.

        ""description"": ""Karin Herrero volvió a sembrar el pánico en el backstage de LOS40 Primavera Pop con uno de sus juegos más temidos: El JUEGO del EGO. ¿Cómo de egocéntricos son nuestros artistas? ¿Están al tanto de las carreras de sus compañeros o solo se miran su propio ombligo? Este año, además, El JUEGO del EGO cuenta con una trampa inesperada: Un reto truculento al que deberán enfrentarse los artistas que demuestren ser unos egocéntricos.\n\nAna Mena, Lola Índigo, Tiago PZK, Chanel, Justin Quiles, Marc Seguí, Mau y Ricky, Walls, Hens, Marlon, Bombai, David Otero, Nil Moliner o Zzoilo fueron los artistas que no pudieron escapar al micro de Karin ni a sus perversos retos. La tragedia está servida.\n\nSi quieres música y entretenimiento, cine y TV, curiosidades, bromas o juegos y challenges con los artistas del momento, no olvides suscribirte a nuestro canal: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=los40principales\n\nTambién estamos en tu móvil 📲 Descárgate la APP de LOS40: http://onelink.to/los40app \n\n🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤 \n\nNuestras redes sociales:  \n\nhttp://instagram.com/los40spain \nhttps://twitter.com/Los40 \nhttps://www.facebook.com/los40/ \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@los40spain\n\n📻 📻 📻 📻 📻 📻 📻 📻 📻 📻 📻 📻 📻 \n\n* Escucha la radio más global y con los éxitos del momento: https://play.los40.com/ \n* Consulta el chart musical más potente del mundo hispanohablante: la Lista de LOS40: http://los40.com/lista40/?o=VL40 \n* Diviértete con nosotros y con los cantantes y grupos más exitosos del momento: http://los40.com/  \n\n#LOS40 #AndaYa #ElJuegoDelEgo"",

Halsey \n\n[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]\nHey, I was doing just fine before I met you\nI drink too much\nAnd that's an issuebut I'm okay\nHey, you tell your friends\nIt was nice to meet them\nBut I hope I never see them again\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]\nI know it breaks your heart\nMoved to the city in a broke-down car\nAnd four years, no calls\nNow you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar\nAnd I-I-I can't stop\nNo, I-I-I can't stop\n\n[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]\nSo, baby, pull me closer\nIn the backseat of your Rover\nThat I know you can't afford\nBite that tattoo on your shoulder\nPull the sheets right off the corner\nOf the mattress that you stole\nFrom your roommate back in Boulder\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\n[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]\nWe ain't ever getting older\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\n[Verse 2: Halsey]\nYou look as good as the day I met you\nI forget just why I left you, I was insane\nStay and play that blink-182 song\nThat we beat to death in Tucson, okay\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]\nI know it breaks your heart\nMoved to the city in a broke-down car\nAnd four years, no call\nNow I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar\nAnd I-I-I can't stop\nNo, I-I-I can't stop\n\n[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]\nSo, baby, pull me closer\nIn the backseat of your Rover\nThat I know you can't afford\nBite that tattoo on your shoulder\nPull the sheets right off the corner\nOf the mattress that you stole\nFrom your roommate back in Boulder\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\n[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]\nWe ain't ever getting older\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\n[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]\nSo, baby, pull me closer\nIn the backseat of your Rover\nThat I know you can't afford\nBite that tattoo on your shoulder\nPull the sheets right off the corner\nOf the mattress that you stole\nFrom your roommate back in Boulder\nWe ain't ever getting older\n\n[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]\nWe ain't ever getting older\n(No, we ain't ever getting older)\nWe ain't ever getting older\n(No, we ain't ever getting older)\nWe ain't ever getting older\n(We ain't ever getting older)\nWe ain't ever getting older\n(No, we ain't ever getting older)\n(We ain't ever getting older)\n(No, we ain't ever getting older)\n\n.........\n📷 Wallpaper: https://unsplash.com/\n.........\n📧Contact: monstafluffmusicnetwork@gmail.com\n.........\n\n#TheChainsmokers #Closer #Lyrics #Halsey"",
