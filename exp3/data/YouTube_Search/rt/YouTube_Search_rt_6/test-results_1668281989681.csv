People thought it was just too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn’t satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.\n\nHe imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer’s perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the groundbut since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. \n\nIn a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. \n\nEinstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference\n\nHe imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. \n\nHowever, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can’t be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. \n\nThis was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.\n\nIt’s important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes onlybut it is really in 3D.  \n\nIn order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury’s orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. \n\nBut many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. \n#generalrelativity\n#einstein\nWhy is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. \n\nGeneral relativity does not answer everything. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn’t really tell us what exactly it is."",

        ""title"": ""The Science of Extreme Time Dilation in Interstellar"",
        ""description"": ""For every one hour on Miller's planet, time elapses roughly 7 years on Earth. How is that possible? In this fun video, we'll explore the science behind #Time #Dilation.\nWatch part 2 of the Interstellar series: https://youtu.be/ML7mh_2_MUE\n\nIf you'd like to see more of this kind of video, consider supporting our work by becoming a member today!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/BeeyondIdeas/join\n\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/beeyond.ideas/\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:08 Recap of Einstein's relativity\n2:14 Gravitational redshift\n4:46 Time dilation in Interstellar\n6:27 One second on Miller's equals one day on Earth\n8:32 The problem with this extreme time dilation\n\nPS: Due to copyright restrictions, several music tracks used in this video had to be substituted with tracks from the YouTube audio library.  \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nScript:\n\nWe touch upon the fundamentals of this topic from our previous video, about Einstein’s relativity. You can check out the video herebut just to give you a brief summary, we can say the following.\nUnder the influence of a strong gravitational field, time slows down. So if you’re just hanging out near a massive object, you will experience the effect of time going slower.  \n\nBut gravity isn’t the only thing that can warp time. According to another one of Einstein's theories, special relativity, time slows down for an object when it moves. Combining these two concepts together, we could consider this scenario.\n\nSuppose that we walk up a flight of stairs. Our body is slowly moved away from earth, meaning that we will experience time going faster. But at the same time, since we are not stationary while going up, we should experience time going slower. So being farther from the pull of Earth's gravity causes our clock to tick fasterbut moving “counteracts” this effect. Of course, this is all oversimplified.\n\nLet’s consider two comparable cases. We have person A, floating nearby a massive object with a lot of gravity. And person B, just casually floating in an empty void of space. \nPerson A shines a green laser beam toward person B. Because light is a form of vibration, the laser beam has a color that corresponds to 600 trillion vib/s. Now light is also a form of energy, and as that beam of light comes out of that gravity of the massive object, it loses a lot of energy. This loss means that there’s a decrease in frequency. \n\nSo, by the time that beam of light reaches person B, its frequency will have decreased by some factor. That means that instead of the green light, at six hundred trillion vibrations a sec, person B gets only.. let’s say 10 billion vib/s. Which is a microwave radio beam. This phenomenon is called the gravitational redshift.\n\nIndividual wiggles don't just go anywhere and disappear. Since person A creates 600 trillion wiggles every sec, while person B only gets 10 billion every second, the only way this can happen is if one second on one astronaut’s clock is not the same as one second on the other astronaut.\n\nIn other words, it only takes one sec for person A to create those 600 trillion wigglesbut it will take 60,000 seconds, or nearly a day, for person B to receive them. So this is what happens. Our clocks run at wildly different rates. And by \""clocks\"" I don't just mean mechanical or electronic devicesbut also biological clocks, like your heart, your lungs, your brain, etc. \n\nPerson A takes a breath, takes another breath, and measures a few seconds between the two. For him, everything feels normal. Clocks tick the way they are supposed to. On the other hand person B, watching person A through a telescope, sees everything in slow motion, with several days passing between the two breaths.\n\nSo now revisiting this scene again from #Interstellar, you should get a better understanding as to why Cooper says he will be the same age as his daughter by the time he comes back from the mission.\n\nAccording to Einstein’s special relativity, the greater the acceleration of an object, the slower it will move through time. On Earth, where time is slowed by only a few microseconds per day, gravity’s pull is modest. And at the surface of a black hole, time is slowed to a halt, where the gravity is so humongous that nothing can escape.\n\nIn the movie, Miller’s planet is depicted to be present in the warped space, very close to a black hole Gargantua. Gravity’s pull on Miller’s planet is enormous. So if we apply Einstein’s relativity here, we would know that Miller’s planet would experience time at a very slow rate. But here on Earth, gravity is at a modest rate. And the gravitational force of the sun is also a billion times weaker than Gargantua. So people on Earth “experience time” faster than that of the three astronauts on Miller’s planet."",

        ""title"": ""Dark Matter Explained: What Exactly is Dark Matter? | A Beginner’s Guide to Dark Matter"",
        ""description"": ""Dark matter is an invisible matter that occupies more than half of the space of the observable universe but cannot be detected directly as it doesn’t interact with electromagnetic radiation, like visible light and gamma rays. One of the greatest challenges that astral scientists and researchers face before they can fully understand the universe is so-called \""dark matter.\"" Originally called the ‘missing matter’, dark matter is the name given to particles that don’t absorb or emit light, making them impossible to detect through observing electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThink of it this way—how do you see or observe something in your everyday life?\nYou are able to see things because visible light, a type of electromagnetic radiation, bounces off objects around you and then reaches your eyes. All celestial bodies interact with electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, radio waves, gamma rays, and the rest. More notably, they alter the way radiation travels around them, which is how we detect far-off galaxies hiding billions upon billions of miles away.\nBut dark matter cannot be observed this way, because it doesn’t interact with electromagnetic radiation. Check out this video to learn more about dark matter, how was it first discovered and how is it detected now.\n\n#science #animation #darkmatter\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.nap.edu/read/10079/chapter/7\nhttps://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Rubin/paper.pdf\nhttp://luxdarkmatter.org/\nhttps://www.cns.umass.edu/news-events/news/dark-matter-god-particle-and-collisions-speed-light\n\n\nOriginal Article Link: https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/universe/what-is-dark-matter-and-how-do-we-know-it-exists.html\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com"",

People thought it was just too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn’t satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.\n\nHe imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer’s perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the groundbut since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. \n\nIn a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. \n\nEinstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference\n\nHe imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. \n\nHowever, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can’t be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. \n\nThis was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.\n\nIt’s important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes onlybut it is really in 3D.  \n\nIn order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury’s orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. \n\nBut many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. \n#generalrelativity\n#einstein\nWhy is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. \n\nGeneral relativity does not answer everything. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn’t really tell us what exactly it is."",

        ""title"": ""The Science of Extreme Time Dilation in Interstellar"",
        ""description"": ""For every one hour on Miller's planet, time elapses roughly 7 years on Earth. How is that possible? In this fun video, we'll explore the science behind #Time #Dilation.\nWatch part 2 of the Interstellar series: https://youtu.be/ML7mh_2_MUE\n\nIf you'd like to see more of this kind of video, consider supporting our work by becoming a member today!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/BeeyondIdeas/join\n\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/beeyond.ideas/\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:08 Recap of Einstein's relativity\n2:14 Gravitational redshift\n4:46 Time dilation in Interstellar\n6:27 One second on Miller's equals one day on Earth\n8:32 The problem with this extreme time dilation\n\nPS: Due to copyright restrictions, several music tracks used in this video had to be substituted with tracks from the YouTube audio library.  \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nScript:\n\nWe touch upon the fundamentals of this topic from our previous video, about Einstein’s relativity. You can check out the video herebut just to give you a brief summary, we can say the following.\nUnder the influence of a strong gravitational field, time slows down. So if you’re just hanging out near a massive object, you will experience the effect of time going slower.  \n\nBut gravity isn’t the only thing that can warp time. According to another one of Einstein's theories, special relativity, time slows down for an object when it moves. Combining these two concepts together, we could consider this scenario.\n\nSuppose that we walk up a flight of stairs. Our body is slowly moved away from earth, meaning that we will experience time going faster. But at the same time, since we are not stationary while going up, we should experience time going slower. So being farther from the pull of Earth's gravity causes our clock to tick fasterbut moving “counteracts” this effect. Of course, this is all oversimplified.\n\nLet’s consider two comparable cases. We have person A, floating nearby a massive object with a lot of gravity. And person B, just casually floating in an empty void of space. \nPerson A shines a green laser beam toward person B. Because light is a form of vibration, the laser beam has a color that corresponds to 600 trillion vib/s. Now light is also a form of energy, and as that beam of light comes out of that gravity of the massive object, it loses a lot of energy. This loss means that there’s a decrease in frequency. \n\nSo, by the time that beam of light reaches person B, its frequency will have decreased by some factor. That means that instead of the green light, at six hundred trillion vibrations a sec, person B gets only.. let’s say 10 billion vib/s. Which is a microwave radio beam. This phenomenon is called the gravitational redshift.\n\nIndividual wiggles don't just go anywhere and disappear. Since person A creates 600 trillion wiggles every sec, while person B only gets 10 billion every second, the only way this can happen is if one second on one astronaut’s clock is not the same as one second on the other astronaut.\n\nIn other words, it only takes one sec for person A to create those 600 trillion wigglesbut it will take 60,000 seconds, or nearly a day, for person B to receive them. So this is what happens. Our clocks run at wildly different rates. And by \""clocks\"" I don't just mean mechanical or electronic devicesbut also biological clocks, like your heart, your lungs, your brain, etc. \n\nPerson A takes a breath, takes another breath, and measures a few seconds between the two. For him, everything feels normal. Clocks tick the way they are supposed to. On the other hand person B, watching person A through a telescope, sees everything in slow motion, with several days passing between the two breaths.\n\nSo now revisiting this scene again from #Interstellar, you should get a better understanding as to why Cooper says he will be the same age as his daughter by the time he comes back from the mission.\n\nAccording to Einstein’s special relativity, the greater the acceleration of an object, the slower it will move through time. On Earth, where time is slowed by only a few microseconds per day, gravity’s pull is modest. And at the surface of a black hole, time is slowed to a halt, where the gravity is so humongous that nothing can escape.\n\nIn the movie, Miller’s planet is depicted to be present in the warped space, very close to a black hole Gargantua. Gravity’s pull on Miller’s planet is enormous. So if we apply Einstein’s relativity here, we would know that Miller’s planet would experience time at a very slow rate. But here on Earth, gravity is at a modest rate. And the gravitational force of the sun is also a billion times weaker than Gargantua. So people on Earth “experience time” faster than that of the three astronauts on Miller’s planet."",

        ""title"": ""Dark Matter Explained: What Exactly is Dark Matter? | A Beginner’s Guide to Dark Matter"",
        ""description"": ""Dark matter is an invisible matter that occupies more than half of the space of the observable universe but cannot be detected directly as it doesn’t interact with electromagnetic radiation, like visible light and gamma rays. One of the greatest challenges that astral scientists and researchers face before they can fully understand the universe is so-called \""dark matter.\"" Originally called the ‘missing matter’, dark matter is the name given to particles that don’t absorb or emit light, making them impossible to detect through observing electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThink of it this way—how do you see or observe something in your everyday life?\nYou are able to see things because visible light, a type of electromagnetic radiation, bounces off objects around you and then reaches your eyes. All celestial bodies interact with electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, radio waves, gamma rays, and the rest. More notably, they alter the way radiation travels around them, which is how we detect far-off galaxies hiding billions upon billions of miles away.\nBut dark matter cannot be observed this way, because it doesn’t interact with electromagnetic radiation. Check out this video to learn more about dark matter, how was it first discovered and how is it detected now.\n\n#science #animation #darkmatter\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.nap.edu/read/10079/chapter/7\nhttps://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Rubin/paper.pdf\nhttp://luxdarkmatter.org/\nhttps://www.cns.umass.edu/news-events/news/dark-matter-god-particle-and-collisions-speed-light\n\n\nOriginal Article Link: https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/universe/what-is-dark-matter-and-how-do-we-know-it-exists.html\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com"",

        ""description"": ""Quantum physics deals with the foundation of our world – the electrons in an atom, the protons inside the nucleus, the quarks that build those protons, and the photons that we perceive as light. These constitute everything that we are made of, both matter and energy. But how is it any different from regular physics? The 'regular' physics is the physics that deals with Newton’s laws of motion and its related mechanics. This is more formally called Classical Physics.\n\nThis is the physics of our day-to-day lives—the rolling of balls, the rotation of the earth, and the mechanics of engines. Quantum physics deals with particles that are incredibly small and hence, the laws of classical physics don’t apply in this world. In this video, we discuss the meaning of quantum physics and how is it going to change how we perceive the world around us.\n\n#quantumphysics #quantummechanics #quantumworld\n\nReferences:\nhttps://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/quantum-physics\nhttps://www.insidescience.org/second-quantum-revolution/quantum-history\nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-010-1440-3_7\n\nOriginal Article Link: https://www.scienceabc.com/pure-sciences/what-is-quantum-physics.html\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/scienceabcofficial/ \n\nFollow us on LinkedIn!\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/scienceabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com"",

        ""title"": ""Quantum Entanglement: Explained in REALLY SIMPLE Words"",
        ""description"": ""Quantum entanglement is a physical resource, like energy, that is possible between quantum systems. When a coin spins on a flat surface, it’s in a state of superposition between its two faces—head and tails. Similarly, electrons in their natural state exist as a superposition of both up and down spin. Only when measured do they give a definite value of up or down, which, in technical terms, is referred to as the “collapse of the wavefunction”.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, wave function collapse occurs when a wave function, which was initially in a superposition of a few states, reduces to a single state due to interaction with the external world.\n\nWhen a pair of electrons are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity, their spin states can get entangled, which is what scientists call the quantum entanglement of electrons.\n\n\nQuantum entanglement was first recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Roson and Schrodinger. In this video, we explain quantum entanglement in simple terms so that it becomes accessible to laymen and children who are interested to know about quantum entanglement\n\n\n\nIntro - 0:00\n\nIntroduction to Quantum Mechanics - 0:43\nPrincipal quantum numbers - 1:47\nSpin quantum number and superposition - 3:17\nSchrödinger’s cat experiment - 4:06\nQuantum entanglement of electrons - 5:23\nApplications of quantum entanglement - 6:36\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/07/nists-quantum-logic-clock-returns-top-performance\n\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-entangle/\nhttps://news.mit.edu/2018/light-ancient-quasars-helps-confirm-quantum-entanglement-0820\nhttps://magazine.caltech.edu/post/untangling-entanglement\nhttps://export.arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1707/1707.01339.pdf\n\n\n\n#science #animation #QuantumEntanglement\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com"",

More precise time-keeping eventually came along to put time in more convenient boxes. But what exactly are we measuring? Andrew Zimmerman Jones contemplates whether time is something that physically exists or is just in our heads.\n\n\nLesson by Andrew Zimmerman Jones, directed by Nice Shoes.\n\nThank you so much to our patrons for your support!

        ""title"": ""The Most Successful Scientific Theory Ever: The Standard Model"",
        ""description"": ""The Standard Model of particle physics is the most successful scientific theory of all time. It describes how everything in the universe is made of 12 different types of matter particles, interacting with three forces, all bound together by a rather special particle called the Higgs boson. It’s the pinnacle of 400 years of science and gives the correct answer to hundreds of thousands of experiments. In this explainer, Cambridge University physicist David Tong recreates the model, piece by piece, to provide some intuition for how the fundamental building blocks of our universe fit together. At the end of the video, he also points out what’s missing from the model and what work is left to do in order to complete the Theory of Everything.\n\n**Correction: At  13'50\"", the photon should be included with the three fundamental forces. The animation here is incorrect, while the narration is correct."",

        ""description"": ""Multiverse theory suggests that our universe, which consists of billions and billions of planets, stars and galaxies and extends out tens of billions of light-years, may not be the only universe that exists. There could be another universe that is completely different from ours with its own natural laws. Even more maddeningly, there may not be just onebut an infinite number of such universes, all of which differ from one another and harbor millions of celestial bodies and even intelligent life forms, just as our universe does.\n\nMultiverse theory assumes that our universe is only a small member of an enormous composition of a multitude of universes.\n\nThe idea of multiple universes is so astounding that it has been hypothesized not only in cosmology and astronomybut also in philosophy, music, literature, science fiction, and even religion. Because of the universality of this idea, these “other\"" universes are called by different names, including parallel universes, alternative universes, parallel realities, quantum realities, alternative realities, and more.\nIn this video, we explain what exactly is the multiverse theory and what it means for humankind.\n\n\n#multiverse #science #animation\n\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_cosmo_infl.html\nhttps://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/observatories/satellite/wmap/inflation.html\nhttps://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/multiverse.pdf\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Article Link: https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/universe/multiverse-explained-what-is-the-multiverse-is-multiverse-theory-legit.html\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com"",

        ""title"": ""The Fermi Paradox With Neil deGrasse Tyson - Where Are All The Aliens?"",
        ""description"": ""Since the birth of philosophy, we've never stopped wondering about the answer to the question: Are we alone?\nNeil deGrasse Tyson tackles the possibility of the prevalence of life in the cosmos by comparing our sole data-point we have, life on Earth. He points to the fact that life on Earth formed as soon as it had a chance after the late heavy bombardment period.\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson also extrapolates from the fossil record that Intelligence as we humans have defined it is not necessary for survival, therefore intelligent life in the cosmos might be extremely rare.\n\nIn the summer of 1950 Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, while walking to lunch with his fellow physicists was having a casual conversation about recent UFO reports and the possibility of faster-than-light travel. Allegedly Fermi suddenly during lunch said, \""But where is everybody?\n\nThis later became known as the Fermi problem or paradox. Which is the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial life and the high estimate probability for their existence.\n\nSo what could possibly explain this semblant paradox?\n\nWhatever is preventing non-living matter from undergoing \""Abiogenesis\"" in time, to expanding lasting life as measured by the Kardashev scale, in the context of the Fermi paradox, is known as the \""Great Filter\"".\n\nAs NASA has explored our solar system and beyond, it has developed increasingly sophisticated tools to address our endless curiosity for the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the cosmos. Within our solar system, NASA’s missions have searched for signs of both ancient and current life, especially on Mars and soon, Jupiter’s moon Europa. Beyond our solar system, missions, such as Kepler, are revealing thousands of planets orbiting other stars. Fueling our imaginations further with bewilderment, wondering if there are other civilizations out there, perhaps asking the same question. Are we alone?\n\nA growing number of people believe we've already answered this question due to recent UFO reports over the last few years. However, eye-witness testimony and ambiguous video footage does not qualify as extraordinary evidence to definitively answer this age old question. But to be respectful to the people who believe we've been visited by extraterrestrial crafts, we will dedicate a whole video on the topic.\n\n#fermiparadox #neiltyson #aliens\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our channel \""Science Time\"": https://www.youtube.com/sciencetime24\nSUPPORT us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sciencetime\nBUY Science Time Merch: https://teespring.com/science-time-merch\n\nSources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYzBxo3hbYQ&t=0s \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter#Fermi_paradox\nhttps://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1350/are-we-alone-in-the-universe-revisiting-the-drake-equation/\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-is-taking-a-new-look-at-searching-for-life-beyond-earth\n\""Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson Visits JWST and NASA Goddard\"" by James Webb Space Telescope is licensed under CC BY 2.0"",

        ""title"": ""What Exactly is Spacetime? Explained in Ridiculously Simple Words"",
        ""description"": ""Spacetime, as a concept, is related to a space that consists of 4 dimensions instead of the regular 3-dimensional space. As early as 1905, Einstein proposed a now widely popular theory that the speed of light is independent of the motion of all observers, and that space and time are interconnected in a single continuum. This theory, which is now a cornerstone of modern and quantum physics, is known as Einstein’s special theory of relativity. Einstein's proposed idea of a single continuum where space and time are interwoven is what people call “space-time”.\nAccording to this theory, time—which has traditionally been considered an independent entity according to the principles of classical physics—is affected when a body moves through space. This happens because, according to the theory, time and space are connected and part of a single continuum—spacetime.\nIn this video, we discuss spacetime in absolutely simple words: what exactly is spacetime and how is it related to the force of gravitation and Einstein’s theory of relativity?\n\n#science #animation #spacetime\n\n\nReferences:\nhttps://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/blueshift/index.php/2015/11/25/100-years-of-general-relativity/\nhttps://sci.esa.int/web/lisa-pathfinder/-/56434-spacetime-curvature\nhttps://sites.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/teaching/HPS_0410/chapters/Special_relativity_rel_sim/index.html\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com"",

In 1687, Newton published his book “Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy”. In the book, he described his three Laws of Motion and the Law of Gravity. His book is considered one of the most important writings in the history of mankind. After watching an apple fall, he asked himself a question. And if the apple falls, does the moon also fall? These questions led him to discover the Law of Gravity.\n\nAccording to his Law of Gravitation, every object in the universe enacts its own force of attraction on another object. And this force is the reason why we are stuck on Earth, why the moon orbits the Earth, and indeed, why the universe exists. But that didn’t answer all of Newton’s questions. Like, why do objects attract each other? What is the source of gravity? And why does Mercury's orbit jiggle? \n\nThe rest remained a mystery until the era of Albert Einstein. In 1915, #Einstein published his Theory of General #Relativity, or in other words, his theory of #Gravity. In this theory, Einstein explained gravity and its source. He answered all the questions that Newton couldn’t, like Mercury’s precession. \n\nLet’s take a step back here to 1905, to truly grasp where these different pieces of the puzzle come to life. This year, Einstein published his Theory of Special Relativity. It deals with the speed of light and the motion of objects. It was fine with non-accelerating objectsbut the theory did not apply when gravity was present, or if the object was accelerating. He couldn’t quite figure the rest out. Until one fine day in 1907. He was observing a window washer on a ladder and had an epiphany. \n\nHe thought about what he would be experiencing while falling. He imagined himself there and realized that while falling, the ground would not be pushing him, so he would be in a free fall. That put some of the pieces togetherbut he still wasn’t fully finished. He began to think about falling again, this time he imagined himself in a room with no windows. On the surface of the Earth, you would weigh whatever your weight is now. But imagine if the room was in a spacecraft, moving in an upward direction with the same 9.8 meters per second squared as here on the ground. In that moment, if you were to weigh yourself, you would weigh the same as you do on Earth. Einstein realized that the observer would not be able to tell if he is on a spaceship, or on the surface of the Earth. That is because he would be moving at the exact same rate of acceleration. There would be no way to tell the difference. \n\nThis phenomenon is called the Equivalence Principle, which states that an object that is accelerating free of any gravitational pull is essentially no different than the same object that is stationary but affected by gravity. In other words, something moving in space with no gravity has the same mass as something on earth that is not moving. In his special theory of relativity, he could only deal with non-accelerating objects and the speed of light. \n\nLet’s pause here for a second. This means that at that point, he knew how to unify his theory of special relativity with gravity. Luckily, he didn’t stop there. He did another thought experiment. This time he imagined what would happen if he pointed a laser beam from one side of the room towards the other. If the room were in a spaceship that was moving upwards with the same acceleration rate as earth, the height of the beam would slightly be lower on the other side of the room. As the floor moved up, it curved the light and caused it to bend down. But, this principle only applied in space. When he thought about the same experiment on earth, the light would appear to be straight. Of course, these two scenarios only happened in his brain. Let’s just take a brief moment to appreciate how brilliant he is to be able to conduct that experiment, all of that, in his brain. \n\nEinstein wasn’t convinced though, as this violated the principle of equivalence. The acceleration of the room on the spaceship was the same as under the influence of gravity. The heights should be the same in both cases, so why were they different? He realized that the only possibility could be that the light beam must be bending under the gravitational influence. But how could this be? What does this bending of light mean?"",

        ""description"": ""A black hole is a celestial body or simply a place in space where the gravitational pull is so high that nothing, not even light can escape it. This is why it's completely black, and hence it's called a black hole. A black hole's “surface,” called its event horizon, defines the boundary where the velocity needed to escape exceeds the speed of light.\n\nWhen a massive star dies, it leaves a small but dense remnant core in its wake. If the mass of the core if more than around 3 times the mass of the sun, the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and a black hole is formed.\n\nA black hole is not just empty space; in fact, it’s a great deal of amount packed into a very small area. Think of a star which is 10 times more massive than our is squeezed into a sphere which has the diameter equal to the size of New York city. The result will be a celestial object whose gravitational field is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. This is why black holes are named so, because they are pitch black!\n\n\n\""Black holes explained\"" is a short-animated video explaining the science of ‘what is a black hole’ and ‘how black holes are formed’? The \""black hole picture 2019\"" is a recent event that occurred in April 2019, which involved the release of the first ever black hole picture to the general public. But what are black holes? How are black holes formed?

These are three spatial dimensions and one time dimension in the universe. With these 4 coordinates, you could rendezvous with anyone anywhere in the universe. In fact these 4 dimensions can describe any event in the universe. \n  \nBut how did the idea of time as a dimension come about? How can we best visualize these 4 dimensions? And what really happens when space and time start doing seemingly weird things when two objects move relative to each other? \n\nIn the late 1800’s, scientists had recognized that there was an inconsistency between two theories – Newton’s laws of motion, and Maxwell’s equations describing electricity and magnetism. The problem was the speed of light. \n\nMaxwell had shown that light was a self-propagating electromagnetic wave. And his theory predicted its speed to be about 300,000 km/s. \n\nThe question was what would the measured speed of light be if the person measuring it was moving. According to Newton, this moving observer should measure a different speed, than someone who was not moving. The measured speed should be the speed of the person, PLUS the speed of light. \n\nIn 1887, Michelson and Morley devised a highly sensitive experiment to measure the speed of light in the direction of motion of the earth. They found that the speed of light does not vary at all, due to the motion of the earth. A resolution of this unexpected result came from Albert Einstein who proposed that Newton’s laws of motion needed to be modified. He determined that the speed of light does not change in any reference frame, and worked out the implications of this idea. \n\nEinstein showed that observers moving at different speeds will disagree about distance and time between two events. In other words, they will experience space and time differently. \n\nHermann Minkowski realized that relativity is really a theory about the geometrical relationship between space and time, and coined the term \""spacetime.\"" He suggested an easier way to visualize these four dimensions - by eliminating one of the dimensions, and making the vertical axis timebut in terms of length.\n\nSomething not moving spatially would be depicted as a vertical line. This is called called this a world line for the particle. \n\nA uniformly moving point would be depicted as a diagonal line on this graph because it would be moving in at least one of the spatial coordinates as it is moving forward in time. An accelerating particle would be a curved line. A light flash somewhere in this 2D space would spread in all directions with time. This forms the shape of a cone. So Minkowski called this a light cone. \n\nA light cone represents all the future events in spacetime that the light reaches from its initial event A. An upside down cone is the past light cone, and represents all the past events in spacetime that reach Event A.\n\nEvent A can be you here and now. The points outside these two light cones are causally disconnected from event A, meaning they cannot reach or be reached by event A. \n\nHow does special relativity enter affect world lines and light cones. Two observers moving relative to each other will not agree on simultaneity. Each will perceive the other's light cone as being tilted such that their observations being different can be explained. \n#minkowskispacetime\n#lightcones\n#worldlines \nWhat this shows is that simultaneity is relative to the observer. There is no absolute simultaneity in the universe. But each observer sees and experiences exactly the same spacetime. And both will agree on causality. Causality is always preserved in a universe with a finite speed of light. I will have more details on this issue of causality in a future video."",

        ""title"": ""Faster Than Light Speed Travel With Neil deGrasse Tyson"",
        ""description"": ""Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson explains the possibility of going faster than the speed of light. If we look at the Einstein's special relativity theory, the speed of light in vacuum has constant velocity of 186,282 miles per second.  If you could travel at this speed, you could go around the Earth 7.5 times in one second. \n\n\n\nIn 1994, Miguel Alcubierre proposed a method that would take us beyond the speed of light limit.  In his mathematical theory, he used two points in space-time to demonstrate the expansion and contraction of space fabric. The idea of Alcubierre's theory was that we could use this space-time warp to make an object travel faster than light.\n\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson takes examples from science fiction works like Star Trek to demonstrate and explain how an advanced civilization could be capable of manipulating the fabric of space-time itself in order to travel faster than the speed of light.\n\n\nEinstein's theory of special relativity states that energy and mass are interchangeable, and speed of light travel is impossible for material objects that, unlike photons, have a non-zero rest mass.\n\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson explains how Einstein's theory of general relativity allows for time itself to slow down if you travel at relativistic velocity\n\n\nEinstein's theory of general relativity mathematically predicts the existence of wormholesbut none have been discovered to date. Even if a wormhole could form, it would most likely be very unstable. Wormholes are still speculative because nobody really knows if you could pass through it. The math suggests that you need some sort of exotic material to pry the throat of the wormhole opening so that it wont collapse in on it self. Even then it is possibly unstable.\n\n\n#neiltyson #science #lightspeed\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our channel \""Science Time\"": https://www.youtube.com/sciencetime24\nSUPPORT us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sciencetime\nBUY Science Time Merch: https://teespring.com/science-time-merch\n\n\nSources:\nJose Luis Blázquez-Salcedo, Christian Knoll, Eugen Radu.

It would be funny if you travel back in time to see a baby version of you, 20 years ago. But instead, when you jumped out of the machine, you are in the shape of a baby, just like the one you’d like to see in the first place.\n\nIn our understanding of the normal flow of time, we are actually moving from the past to the future. There are different interpretations of thisbut what people usually refer to as time travel usually means either getting to the future faster or travelling into the past. In any case, instead of the normal flow of time, we change the rate by some X amount. \n\nAccording to Newtonian mechanics, we either perceive time as linear and deterministic. But ever since Albert Einstein published the theory of relativity, the Newtonian conception of absolute time and space has been replaced by the idea that time has a subjective significance to everyone. In this case, time is one dimension of space-time in special relativity (SR). And of dynamically curved space-time in general relativity (GR).\n\nFrom here on, the possibility of moving backwards or forwards in time might not be as farfetched as one might think. In this case, it might just be as simple as how ordinary beings can move between different points in space.\n \nThere are many different hypothetical answers for time travel, and over the years, those scenarios have been put forward by notable scientists. Essentially, these scenarios are different from the notion of a physical machine with levers and dials that H.G. Wells proposed.\n\nEinstein also previously showed that time actually runs differently in different situations. This basically implies that time passes at different rates for different observers based on their travelling speed. \n \nHere’s a very interesting example. The astronauts onboard the ISS orbit the Earth at 28,000 km/h (17,500 miles/h). Taking into account the conflicting factors of GR and SR, we’ll get the net time dilation effects on the astronauts with respect to an observer on the planet’s surface.\n\nThe astronaut onboard the spaceship will get a #TimeDilation of -0.000026 seconds per day. For a typical crew member who stays on the ISS for 6 months, the total time dilation would be about 5 milliseconds. In such a case where the astronaut has a twin, the astronaut has experienced less passage of time than his twin counterpart who remained on the Earth’s surface.\n\nGiving the option to fast-forward through time is a pretty cool idea. Though it would be a one-way process where you wouldn't have the chance to go back. There might, however, be some scientific basis within the theory of relativity, supporting the possibility of time travel under certain scenarios.\n\nThere was a scientist named Kurt Gödel in the early 19th century. He showed that there are some solutions to the field equations of GR. It describes space-time so warped that they contain “closed time-like curves”. This is where an individual time-cone twists and closes in on itself. It allows a path from the present to the past or to the future. \n \nSince we're on the topic, we'll mention a few notable attempts by popular scientists on time travel.\nIn 1994, Theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre proposed a speculative scenario. This involves a spacecraft that would contract space in front of it, and expand space behind it. If this shortcut is taken, it will result in effective faster-than-light travel. You might even be able to use it for time travel.\n\nOther theoretical physicists have been thinking about these kinds of shortcuts as well. For example, Kip Thorne and Paul Davies think it's possible to use a wormhole and travel through space-time. In a similar way as GR could be used to make instantaneous spatial travel plausible."",
