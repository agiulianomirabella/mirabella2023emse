        ""title"": ""The Science of Extreme Time Dilation in Interstellar"",
        ""description"": ""For every one hour on Miller's planet, time elapses roughly 7 years on Earth. How is that possible? In this fun video, we'll explore the science behind #Time #Dilation.\nWatch part 2 of the Interstellar series: https://youtu.be/ML7mh_2_MUE\n\nIf you'd like to see more of this kind of video, consider supporting our work by becoming a member today!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/BeeyondIdeas/join\n\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/beeyond.ideas/\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:08 Recap of Einstein's relativity\n2:14 Gravitational redshift\n4:46 Time dilation in Interstellar\n6:27 One second on Miller's equals one day on Earth\n8:32 The problem with this extreme time dilation\n\nPS: Due to copyright restrictions, several music tracks used in this video had to be substituted with tracks from the YouTube audio library.  \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nScript:\n\nWe touch upon the fundamentals of this topic from our previous video, about Einstein’s relativity. You can check out the video herebut just to give you a brief summary, we can say the following.\nUnder the influence of a strong gravitational field, time slows down. So if you’re just hanging out near a massive object, you will experience the effect of time going slower.  \n\nBut gravity isn’t the only thing that can warp time. According to another one of Einstein's theories, special relativity, time slows down for an object when it moves. Combining these two concepts together, we could consider this scenario.\n\nSuppose that we walk up a flight of stairs. Our body is slowly moved away from earth, meaning that we will experience time going faster. But at the same time, since we are not stationary while going up, we should experience time going slower. So being farther from the pull of Earth's gravity causes our clock to tick fasterbut moving “counteracts” this effect. Of course, this is all oversimplified.\n\nLet’s consider two comparable cases. We have person A, floating nearby a massive object with a lot of gravity. And person B, just casually floating in an empty void of space. \nPerson A shines a green laser beam toward person B. Because light is a form of vibration, the laser beam has a color that corresponds to 600 trillion vib/s. Now light is also a form of energy, and as that beam of light comes out of that gravity of the massive object, it loses a lot of energy. This loss means that there’s a decrease in frequency. \n\nSo, by the time that beam of light reaches person B, its frequency will have decreased by some factor. That means that instead of the green light, at six hundred trillion vibrations a sec, person B gets only.. let’s say 10 billion vib/s. Which is a microwave radio beam. This phenomenon is called the gravitational redshift.\n\nIndividual wiggles don't just go anywhere and disappear. Since person A creates 600 trillion wiggles every sec, while person B only gets 10 billion every second, the only way this can happen is if one second on one astronaut’s clock is not the same as one second on the other astronaut.\n\nIn other words, it only takes one sec for person A to create those 600 trillion wigglesbut it will take 60,000 seconds, or nearly a day, for person B to receive them. So this is what happens. Our clocks run at wildly different rates. And by \""clocks\"" I don't just mean mechanical or electronic devicesbut also biological clocks, like your heart, your lungs, your brain, etc. \n\nPerson A takes a breath, takes another breath, and measures a few seconds between the two. For him, everything feels normal. Clocks tick the way they are supposed to. On the other hand person B, watching person A through a telescope, sees everything in slow motion, with several days passing between the two breaths.\n\nSo now revisiting this scene again from #Interstellar, you should get a better understanding as to why Cooper says he will be the same age as his daughter by the time he comes back from the mission.\n\nAccording to Einstein’s special relativity, the greater the acceleration of an object, the slower it will move through time. On Earth, where time is slowed by only a few microseconds per day, gravity’s pull is modest. And at the surface of a black hole, time is slowed to a halt, where the gravity is so humongous that nothing can escape.\n\nIn the movie, Miller’s planet is depicted to be present in the warped space, very close to a black hole Gargantua. Gravity’s pull on Miller’s planet is enormous. So if we apply Einstein’s relativity here, we would know that Miller’s planet would experience time at a very slow rate. But here on Earth, gravity is at a modest rate. And the gravitational force of the sun is also a billion times weaker than Gargantua. So people on Earth “experience time” faster than that of the three astronauts on Miller’s planet."",

People thought it was just too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn’t satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.\n\nHe imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer’s perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the groundbut since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. \n\nIn a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. \n\nEinstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference\n\nHe imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. \n\nHowever, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can’t be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. \n\nThis was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.\n\nIt’s important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes onlybut it is really in 3D.  \n\nIn order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury’s orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. \n\nBut many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. \n#generalrelativity\n#einstein\nWhy is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. \n\nGeneral relativity does not answer everything. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn’t really tell us what exactly it is."",
