His message is for the whole world.\""\nVice-President of India, Krishnakant\n \n\""Osho is one of the most important educators and philosophical and religious leaders in the late 20th century...I firmly believe that hundreds and thousands ...would be thrilled, delighted and gain a new perspective on life by reading his books.\""\nRobert Rimmer, author The Harvard Experiment and Proposition 31\n \n\""A great mystic, a great philosopher.... In his own way Osho captured the essence of ancient wisdom, related it to contemporary needs, tempered it with the modern times and became a powerful messenger of eternal Indian thought and Indian wisdom.\""\nDr. Manmohan Singh, former finance minister of India,\n \n\""Osho is certainly a religious man, an intelligent human, and one of those rare humans expressing himself with joy.\""\nPaul reps, author of Zen Flesh, Zen Bones\n \n\""Here is somebody who fuses everything and makes it understandable to people, and it makes sense. And he also challenges very fixed beliefs, challenges religions which have tradition and ritual and so forth.\""\nAroon Purie, Editor of India Today\n \n\""Wit and playfulness are a tremendously serious transcendence of evil, and this is one thing that Osho understood better than any contemporary teacher that I can think of. Gurdjieff had an element of that in his teachingsbut certainly in the past fifty years there has not existed a teacher in the world who understood the value of playfulness and wit quite so well as Osho.\""\nTom Robbins, author of Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Still Life with Woodpecker and Jitterbug Perfume and others.\n \n\""Osho is such a vision that stands for the welfare of the whole of humanity, transcending the narrow boundaries of religions. Though today's man is so caught up in his myriad problems, all of Osho's books and discourses suggest simple and easy ways for man's liberation.\""\nLokendra Bahadur Chand, the former premier, of Nepal"",

            ""textDisplay"": ""It all works fine if we live in a simulation. Then all adjustments including lives are just blips on a screen, and death becomes delete. \r\n\r\nIt also has to be realized God(our programmer), is not in his computer, nor bound by the rules of his created simulation, any more than we are bound by the rules of south park or the simsons. He could be the town drunk in his worldbut because he can press delete, or adjust our reality to any thing he wishes, to us he is God.\r\n \r\nI asked God, \""Are you perfect\"". His answer was no. \r\n\r\nI then asked \""Was Adam and Eve perfect. His answer was no. \r\n\r\nNext...What about your immature re-action of deciding to throw Adam out and burn him instead of reviewing his schematics and correcting problems? Answer...I was a lot younger and more hot headed then. \r\n\r\nI never sinned to be born. What is this crock of original sin? Answer: It is a glitch in the matrix I can not correct, and it affects all new introductions to the simulation. \r\n\r\nWhat is Jesus? Answer: He is a patch program that if you use it removes this original defects called sin you inherit from the program. \r\n\r\nI have been asked many times why death has to occur for this transfer to take place. Answer: Because at this time it is the limits of my technology. \r\n\r\nThe prayer includes several key words i will accent. Here it is.\r\n \r\nJESUS, I BELIEVE in you, FORGIVE me this original SIN and all others, COME INTO my life and help me to live it better. \r\n\r\nThis patch does several things. One, the destination of your consciousness has now been transferred from a burning garbage dump, and paired with an immortal body that will be defect free and last forever. This body will also reside in a new defect free universe, on a redesigned, defect free earth. All this for the price of a one sentence prayer taking less than 30 seconds to pray. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy this way. Unknownbut I assure you it works. I have done it. This is his simulation, and he gets to choose the key words. What they are really does not matter, it is the effectiveness that counts.\r\n\r\nIn business there is a saying that if you can not make at least two dollars to every one invested keep your money in your pocket. Well look at all that is promised with no risk at all. It is worth it just in case it is real. I mean 30 seconds invested just for the possibility. It is crazy not to try with the massive rewards compared to the investment.\r\n\r\n \r\nAs for the many evils unjust on the current earth, such as murder for example, and other horrendous crimes of our reality they are all real, and I asked about this. Answer: This simulation has too much wrong, so I no longer fix it. The new bodies are ready, the new universe almost ready so I have poured my resources into this. The reality of the universe you are now in is about to suffer total cascade failure, and end. It has already began.

This applies to us all. \r\n\r\nWhat happens to those that do not accept. Answer: They end up in the trash, as they can not be allowed to destabilize the matrix of the new universe with there still present defects. \r\n\r\nDo they burn forever. Yes as long as new materials are added. I then saw a vision of Scotland and its forever burning bogs. God assured me that this is the fires the defective people that die will suffer from after death, not constant burning of individualsbut with fires that can spring up anywhere at any time and will be burning in different parts forever. \r\n\r\nIn short, this is a bad reality we are in. It will not be corrected. Like an old car, you get rid of it and drive away in a nice new one. Pray the patch prayer and see.

            ""textOriginal"": ""It all works fine if we live in a simulation. Then all adjustments including lives are just blips on a screen, and death becomes delete. \r\n\r\nIt also has to be realized God(our programmer), is not in his computer, nor bound by the rules of his created simulation, any more than we are bound by the rules of south park or the simsons. He could be the town drunk in his worldbut because he can press delete, or adjust our reality to any thing he wishes, to us he is God.\r\n \r\nI asked God, \""Are you perfect\"". His answer was no. \r\n\r\nI then asked \""Was Adam and Eve perfect. His answer was no. \r\n\r\nNext...What about your immature re-action of deciding to throw Adam out and burn him instead of reviewing his schematics and correcting problems? Answer...I was a lot younger and more hot headed then. \r\n\r\nI never sinned to be born. What is this crock of original sin? Answer: It is a glitch in the matrix I can not correct, and it affects all new introductions to the simulation. \r\n\r\nWhat is Jesus? Answer: He is a patch program that if you use it removes this original defects called sin you inherit from the program. \r\n\r\nI have been asked many times why death has to occur for this transfer to take place. Answer: Because at this time it is the limits of my technology. \r\n\r\nThe prayer includes several key words i will accent. Here it is.\r\n \r\nJESUS, I BELIEVE in you, FORGIVE me this original SIN and all others, COME INTO my life and help me to live it better. \r\n\r\nThis patch does several things. One, the destination of your consciousness has now been transferred from a burning garbage dump, and paired with an immortal body that will be defect free and last forever. This body will also reside in a new defect free universe, on a redesigned, defect free earth. All this for the price of a one sentence prayer taking less than 30 seconds to pray. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy this way. Unknownbut I assure you it works. I have done it. This is his simulation, and he gets to choose the key words. What they are really does not matter, it is the effectiveness that counts.\r\n\r\nIn business there is a saying that if you can not make at least two dollars to every one invested keep your money in your pocket.
