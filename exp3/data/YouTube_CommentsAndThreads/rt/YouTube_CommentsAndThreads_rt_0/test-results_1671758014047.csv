Also, i think Russia commit horrific war crimes in a totally unjustified and unprovoked war for which Russia alone is to blame.\n\nNot to Snowden. That he fled to Russia is the fault of the USA and the whole western world and not really his personal choice - unless you consider spending the rest of the life in prison for no good reason as a valid \""choice\"".\n\nYes, Snowden published top secret information. However, this was Top Secret information that should not have been top secret and that related to criminal activities of the US goverment in clear and unexcusable violation of both the normal law and the constitution. He tried to pass the information to those in charge before but nobody had a problem with the law breaking and there were no proper channels for wistleblowers in place. So the only choices he had were a) accepting that the constitutional rights and even human rights of millions of Ammericans (and even more foreigners in allied countries on top) are violated on a daily basis in blatend disregard for the law or b) break the law himself to publish this shit.\n\nHe did b) and it was the right choice. It is worth mentioning that he did so in the most prudent way possible to not endanger any human intelligence sources. He worked only with a handfull of 100% trustworthy journalists - only the best of the best - and made them before agree to a very strict set of rules. Everything that was published was submitted to the NSA before publication. The NSA was given the opportunity to comment on potential endangerment of human intelligence sources and only in the absence of any reasonable concerns in this regards, publication took place. This was extremely careful and absolutely reasonable in my opinion. Compare this with the acitivities of Mr Assange - who in my opinion is an egocentric ... that puts his own publicity first and the interest of the people only second. He dumped tons of data without any checking and without any warning. This, in fact, did endanger human intelligence sources by a lot. Snowden, in contrast, minimised the risk as much as humanly possible.\n\nDespite the very careful approach of Mr Snowden and the greater good of the public that was achieved by the publication - finally allowing the public to check to a reasonable degree what is going on there and how their constitutional rights were infringed - the goverment tried to lock him up for basically a lifetime. And for this, Dems and Republicans are equally at fault - Obama, Trump and Biden all failed to pardon him or commute his sentence to a reasonable one. While Trump is simply a morron that even things this is good, i think both Obama and Biden know/knew that what Snowden did was morally justified but did not pardon out of fear for political Backlash.\n\nThis forced Snowden to stay in Russia - although he clearly would have preferred to go back to the US. And thus, Snowden was under the control of Russia since then. He knows, if he says the wrong stuff or does not act in a way compatible with what Putin wants, he will be imprisoned or worse. He has nowhere to go.\n\nSo yes, it is not right that he cooperates with Russia. But his only other choice would be to be imprisoned for the rest of his life ( by going back to the US) or to be killed (by acting anti-russian in russia). So doing the right thing would require him to become a Martyr, which he is not ready to do, which i can udnerstand. And why should he? He did a lot for the US Public to fight for their rights. The US Public, however, did a shit to then fight for him. So it is quite reasonable when he is disappointed. So why should he still be loyal to the US? On the topic of snowden, the US should be a lot more self critical."",

Funny to me that he said in this interview that he was nervous about his hearing day because it didn’t show, and I was SO impressed by his intelligence and his ability to succinctly communicate! Though I think it’s safe to assume we wouldn’t agree on much politically, I admire him greatly for the position he has taken in this nightmare and HIS bravery in his passionate opposition! I was very disappointed to hear that he’s not running for re-election. If his seat is solid Republican, the chances are probably high a radical will run for it, and I wish he would fight for and retain his seat. Sadly, the GOP is sorely lacking in people with Adam’s integrity and strength of character, and his leaving will be a tremendous loss! This country owes him a TON of gratitude!"",

Does the state investigate? or is the burden of proof on the accuser? either way to get the proof you need to get protected health information... *PRIVATE* protected health information... Lets take another example, a 8 month pregnant woman has a miscarriage, a Neighbor Karen files suit saying she had a late term abortion done (yep I know not a thing does stop people from believing it damn well is) she has photographic proof the woman was pregnant one week and the next she clearly isn't, this Neighbor Karen is not legally allowed to get the private health information to prove an abortion happened? These are incredibly important questions that Republicans would be interested in as well, because it wouldn't be difficult at all for a Liberal to go and accuse someone of having an abortion even if they know they are staunchly against abortion, at what point is it completely improvable, or is it improvable at all? I would hope the state cannot step into private health information like this because if the mother did have a miscarriage at lets say 8 months and lost that baby and is dealing with that loss and then is accused of aborting it and has the state or the legal system in general, force the release of their medical information and how a miscarriage happened instead then we have a much larger issue here than just the lack of abortion access."",

And implications for trillions and trillions of years to come. is it being a staunch supporter of the conservative movement? is it the play by play in the ukrainian russian war? Is it how great our bosses esteem us to be? How educated we are? How refined? How well traveled? Well payed? Will it be our favorite TV shows, or our work out routine? I would argue no. The only thing at all that will make a lasting impact is our relationship with Jesus. Only one name under Heaven given unto men by which we must be saved. One creator, One savior. Sounds extreme and hard to wrap our head around. But it's true. The bible says Jesus gave his life as a ransom for all so we should do the same. And while Jesus was on earth he had no certain dwelling place, or any place to rest his head. Rush Limbaugh spent his whole life being a staunch defender of the conservative moment he died and the world moved on at a rapid pace.Some journalists covering the Russia Ukraine war they were killed and the world moved on at a rapid pace. A week later and they are all but forgotten. \n\n\nAs Tim Tebow said in a presentation where he was covering a magazine cover of a starving famished african child laying in the field. The photographer looked on and took photos but was too afraid to touch the baby for fear of catching something. The photographer later got a big journalist award for the cover and later killed himself the guilt of letting this baby die in the field and doing nothing probably ate him alive. Tim Tebow went on to say I'm afraid you're going to spend all your life and your time on things that don't matter.\n\nAs far as world success and accolades Jesus could care less about any of it. When we stand before God he is not going to care what job we had or where we went to college. The only thing that will matter to God is what you gave and did for others. Jesus said blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. Referring to people who are spiritually bankrupt, who have emptied theirselves, who present themselves to God as beggars. Who have afflicted their soul through self denial and fasting, and who mourn Pleading with God to save them from hell, and to save them from their sins. They  wanted a change from the wicked heart they were born with, and were willing to do anything to get it. So God gave them one. As the bible says I will give them a heart of flesh for their heart of stone. Why would God give you a new heart if youre satisfied with the one you have?\n\nlacking a normal or adequate supply of something specified —often used in combination\n\n\nSo how do we come to this place with God? Where we are concerned about God and what he wants for our lives? Many would say it is a divine process for God's chosen. The bible says to believers I will make your a minister of the new testament and I have chosen you before the foundation of the world to present you Holy and blameless before Christ. The bible also says I will send you the Holy Ghost the comforter to teach you all things. So if we can only come to God because we are chosen that is a very scary thing. What about everyone else???? These are complicated matters. This goes to show we will never be able to fully comprehend God and the way he has designed things. Which is why he said my thoughts are not your thoughts and my ways are not your ways. As high as the Heavens are above the earth so are my ways higher then your and my thoughts higher than yours. If we look at the verse below it further shows Gods choice in the matter \n\n\nFor ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, : But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, , and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: That no flesh should glory in his presence. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\n\n\n\n\n“For our gospel came not unto you in word onlybut also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.”\n\n\nThis is referring to when we see the damage the devil has done, and sin has done, and living a life without God has done. When you come to this place don't fear but its an evident token of your salvation. You have emptied yourself. You have spiritually bankrupted yourself. You have fallen onto the mercy of God in your life and have nothing to offer him. You have come to a place where you live by faith and every good thing comes from him. Which is why we hear his mercies are new every morning. And he is a rewarder of those who seek him diligently. Some people seek so hard because they have found themselves in a place needing a miracle. Which brings to mind the verse the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence but the violent take it by force. We can explore this one a little further another time.\n\nSo we see God chooses people. And reveals himself to them. And teaches them. But what about everyone else. Well basically God sends out his preachers to warn.. How do you respond? Is it an urgent matter for your life?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Ezekiel the bible says I will set before you a watch man and when they blow the trumpet if you dont take warning your blood will be on your own head. But if the watchman fails to blow the trumpet the blood is on the watch mans hands.\n\n\nIs your self pride keeping you from God and holding you back from your eternal destiny? Are you hung up on doing it on your own?\n\nThe bible says God has heard the cry of the humble and he will prepare their heart. You see there is a people out there who God has prepared their heart to receive the message. And when the preachers go out and preach they hear it as the truth, and they hear it as hope. Where the satisfied world sees it as nothing more than mere craziness. A waste of time. An off-score of society, fairy tales. \n\nI pray you will humble yourself under the mighty hand of God. Fast. Repent. Cleanse yourself from all filthiness of the flesh. Pray like David purge me with hyssop so I might be clean wash me so I may be whiter than snow. And he prayed create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from your presence. Take not your Holy Spirit from me."",

Roger Ailes, Nixon's media consultant, later started and was CEO & chairman of the country's most infamous 24/7 right-wing propaganda channel. Finally, by the party supporting TV and movie \""stars\"" to run for and win the Presidency, the entire country was lumbered with both Reagan and TFG.\n\nIn short: the Republican Party learned all of the wrong lessons from Watergate, and we all are suffering because of it. Perhaps we may take some small solace from the fact that Dick Cheney's daughter is one of the people helping to bring the crimes of TFG to light as the vice-chair of the 1/6 Committee."",
