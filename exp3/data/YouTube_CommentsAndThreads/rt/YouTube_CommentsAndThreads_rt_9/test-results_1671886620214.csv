            ""textDisplay"": ""A solid understanding of history has long been the best guide to comprehending the present and anticipating the future. Accordingly, people are most interested in historical questions during times of crisis, when the future seems most uncertain. With the collapse of Communist rule in the Soviet Union, 1989-1991, and as Russians struggle to build a new order on the ruins of the old, historical issues have become very topical. For example, many ask: How did the Bolsheviks, a small movement guided by the teachings of German-Jewish social philosopher Karl Marx, succeed in taking control of Russia and imposing a cruel and despotic regime on its people?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn recent years, Jews around the world have been voicing anxious concern over the specter of anti-Semitism in the lands of the former Soviet Union. In this new and uncertain era, we are told, suppressed feelings of hatred and rage against Jews are once again being expressed. According to one public opinion survey conducted in 1991, for example, most Russians wanted all Jews to leave the country.¬†But precisely why is anti-Jewish sentiment so widespread among the peoples of the former Soviet Union? Why do so many Russians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians and others blame &quot;the Jews&quot; for so much misfortune?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Taboo Subject\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough officially Jews have never made up more than five percent of the country&#39;s total population,¬†they played a highly disproportionate and probably decisive role in the infant Bolshevik regime, effectively dominating the Soviet government during its early years. Soviet historians, along with most of their colleagues in the West, for decades preferred to ignore this subject. The facts, though, cannot be denied.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the notable exception of Lenin (Vladimir Ulyanov), most of the leading Communists who took control of Russia in 1917-20 were Jews. Leon Trotsky (Lev Bronstein) headed the Red Army and, for a time, was chief of Soviet foreign affairs. Yakov Sverdlov (Solomon) was both the Bolshevik party&#39;s executive secretary and -- as chairman of the Central Executive Committee -- head of the Soviet government. Grigori Zinoviev (Radomyslsky) headed the Communist International (Comintern), the central agency for spreading revolution in foreign countries. Other prominent Jews included press commissar Karl Radek (Sobelsohn), foreign affairs commissar Maxim Litvinov (Wallach), Lev Kamenev (Rosenfeld) and Moisei Uritsky.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLenin himself was of mostly Russian and Kalmuck ancestrybut he was also one-quarter Jewish. His maternal grandfather, Israel (Alexander) Blank, was a Ukrainian Jew who was later baptized into the Russian Orthodox Church.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA thorough-going internationalist, Lenin viewed ethnic or cultural loyalties with contempt. He had little regard for his own countrymen. &quot;An intelligent Russian,&quot; he once remarked, &quot;is almost always a Jew or someone with Jewish blood in his veins.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCritical Meetings\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Communist seizure of power in Russia, the Jewish role was probably critical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo weeks prior to the Bolshevik &quot;October Revolution&quot; of 1917, Lenin convened a top secret meeting in St. Petersburg (Petrograd) at which the key leaders of the Bolshevik party&#39;s Central Committee made the fateful decision to seize power in a violent takeover. Of the twelve persons who took part in this decisive gathering, there were four Russians (including Lenin), one Georgian (Stalin), one Pole (Dzerzhinsky), and six Jews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo direct the takeover, a seven-man &quot;Political Bureau&quot; was chosen. It consisted of two Russians (Lenin and Bubnov), one Georgian (Stalin), and four Jews (Trotsky, Sokolnikov, Zinoviev, and Kamenev).¬†Meanwhile, the Petersburg (Petrograd) Soviet -- whose chairman was Trotsky -- established an 18-member &quot;Military Revolutionary Committee&quot; to actually carry out the seizure of power. It included eight (or nine) Russians, one Ukrainian, one Pole, one Caucasian, and six Jews.¬†Finally, to supervise the organization of the uprising, the Bolshevik Central Committee established a five-man &quot;Revolutionary Military Center&quot; as the Party&#39;s operations command. It consisted of one Russian (Bubnov), one Georgian (Stalin), one Pole (Dzerzhinsky), and two Jews (Sverdlov and Uritsky).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContemporary Voices of Warning\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell-informed observers, both inside and outside of Russia, took note at the time of the crucial Jewish role in Bolshevism. Winston Churchill, for one, warned in an article published in the February 8, 1920, issue of the London¬†Illustrated Sunday Herald¬†that Bolshevism is a &quot;worldwide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality.&quot; The eminent British political leader and historian went on to write:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by these international and for the most part atheistical Jews. It is certainly a very great one; it probably outweighs all others. With the notable exception of Lenin, the majority of the leading figures are Jews. Moreover, the principal inspiration and driving power comes from the Jewish leaders. Thus Tchitcherin, a pure Russian, is eclipsed by his nominal subordinate, Litvinoff, and the influence of Russians like Bukharin or Lunacharski cannot be compared with the power of Trotsky, or of Zinovieff, the Dictator of the Red Citadel (Petrograd), or of Krassin or Radek -- all Jews. In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astonishing. And the prominent, if not indeed the principal, part in the system of terrorism applied by the Extraordinary Commissions for Combatting Counter-Revolution [the Cheka] has been taken by Jews, and in some notable cases by Jewesses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeedless to say, the most intense passions of revenge have been excited in the breasts of the Russian people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDavid R. Francis, United States ambassador in Russia, warned in a January 1918 dispatch to Washington: &quot;The Bolshevik leaders here, most of whom are Jews and 90 percent of whom are returned exiles, care little for Russia or any other country but are internationalists and they are trying to start a worldwide social revolution.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Netherlands&#39; ambassador in Russia, Oudendyke, made much the same point a few months later: &quot;Unless Bolshevism is nipped in the bud immediately, it is bound to spread in one form or another over Europe and the whole world as it is organized and worked by Jews who have no nationality, and whose one object is to destroy for their own ends the existing order of things.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;The Bolshevik Revolution,&quot; declared a leading American Jewish community paper in 1920, &quot;was largely the product of Jewish thinking, Jewish discontent, Jewish effort to reconstruct.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an expression of its radically anti-nationalist character, the fledgling Soviet government issued a decree a few months after taking power that made anti-Semitism a crime in Russia. The new Communist regime thus became the first in the world to severely punish all expressions of anti-Jewish sentiment. Soviet officials apparently regarded such measures as indispensable. Based on careful observation during a lengthy stay in Russia, American-Jewish scholar Frank Golder reported in 1925 that &quot;because so many of the Soviet leaders are Jews anti-Semitism is gaining [in Russia], particularly in the army [and] among the old and new intelligentsia who are being crowded for positions by the sons of Israel.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistorians&#39; Views\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSumming up the situation at that time, Israeli historian Louis Rapoport writes:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImmediately after the [Bolshevik] Revolution, many Jews were euphoric over their high representation in the new government. Lenin&#39;s first Politburo was dominated by men of Jewish origins.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnder Lenin, Jews became involved in all aspects of the Revolution, including its dirtiest work. Despite the Communists&#39; vows to eradicate anti-Semitism, it spread rapidly after the Revolution -- partly because of the prominence of so many Jews in the Soviet administration, as well as in the traumatic, inhuman Sovietization drives that followed. Historian Salo Baron has noted that an immensely disproportionate number of Jews joined the new Bolshevik secret police, the Cheka And many of those who fell afoul of the Cheka would be shot by Jewish investigators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe collective leadership that emerged in Lenin&#39;s dying days was headed by the Jew Zinoviev, a loquacious, mean-spirited, curly-haired Adonis whose vanity knew no bounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Anyone who had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Cheka,&quot; wrote Jewish historian Leonard Schapiro, &quot;stood a very good chance of finding himself confronted with, and possibly shot by, a Jewish investigator.&quot;¬†In Ukraine, &quot;Jews made up nearly 80 percent of the rank-and-file Cheka agents,&quot; reports W. Bruce Lincoln, an American professor of Russian history.(Beginning as the¬†Cheka, or¬†Vecheka) the Soviet secret police was later known as the GPU, OGPU, NKVD, MVD and KGB.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn light of all this, it should not be surprising that Yakov M. Yurovksy, the leader of the Bolshevik squad that carried out the murder of the Tsar and his family, was Jewish, as was Sverdlov, the Soviet chief who co-signed Lenin&#39;s execution order.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIgor Shafarevich, a Russian mathematician of world stature, has sharply criticized the Jewish role in bringing down the Romanov monarchy and establishing Communist rule in his country. Shafarevich was a leading dissident during the final decades of Soviet rule. A prominent human rights activist, he was a founding member of the Committee on the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn¬†Russophobia, a book written ten years before the collapse of Communist rule, he noted that Jews were &quot;amazingly&quot; numerous among the personnel of the Bolshevik secret police. The characteristic Jewishness of the Bolshevik executioners, Shafarevich went on, is most conspicuous in the execution of Nicholas II"",

In this new and uncertain era, we are told, suppressed feelings of hatred and rage against Jews are once again being expressed. According to one public opinion survey conducted in 1991, for example, most Russians wanted all Jews to leave the country.¬†But precisely why is anti-Jewish sentiment so widespread among the peoples of the former Soviet Union? Why do so many Russians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians and others blame \""the Jews\"" for so much misfortune?\n\nA Taboo Subject\n\nAlthough officially Jews have never made up more than five percent of the country's total population,¬†they played a highly disproportionate and probably decisive role in the infant Bolshevik regime, effectively dominating the Soviet government during its early years. Soviet historians, along with most of their colleagues in the West, for decades preferred to ignore this subject. The facts, though, cannot be denied.\n\nWith the notable exception of Lenin (Vladimir Ulyanov), most of the leading Communists who took control of Russia in 1917-20 were Jews. Leon Trotsky (Lev Bronstein) headed the Red Army and, for a time, was chief of Soviet foreign affairs. Yakov Sverdlov (Solomon) was both the Bolshevik party's executive secretary and -- as chairman of the Central Executive Committee -- head of the Soviet government. Grigori Zinoviev (Radomyslsky) headed the Communist International (Comintern), the central agency for spreading revolution in foreign countries. Other prominent Jews included press commissar Karl Radek (Sobelsohn), foreign affairs commissar Maxim Litvinov (Wallach), Lev Kamenev (Rosenfeld) and Moisei Uritsky.\n\nLenin himself was of mostly Russian and Kalmuck ancestrybut he was also one-quarter Jewish. His maternal grandfather, Israel (Alexander) Blank, was a Ukrainian Jew who was later baptized into the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nA thorough-going internationalist, Lenin viewed ethnic or cultural loyalties with contempt. He had little regard for his own countrymen. \""An intelligent Russian,\"" he once remarked, \""is almost always a Jew or someone with Jewish blood in his veins.\""\n\nCritical Meetings\n\nIn the Communist seizure of power in Russia, the Jewish role was probably critical.\n\nTwo weeks prior to the Bolshevik \""October Revolution\"" of 1917, Lenin convened a top secret meeting in St. Petersburg (Petrograd) at which the key leaders of the Bolshevik party's Central Committee made the fateful decision to seize power in a violent takeover. Of the twelve persons who took part in this decisive gathering, there were four Russians (including Lenin), one Georgian (Stalin), one Pole (Dzerzhinsky), and six Jews.\n\nTo direct the takeover, a seven-man \""Political Bureau\"" was chosen. It consisted of two Russians (Lenin and Bubnov), one Georgian (Stalin), and four Jews (Trotsky, Sokolnikov, Zinoviev, and Kamenev).¬†Meanwhile, the Petersburg (Petrograd) Soviet -- whose chairman was Trotsky -- established an 18-member \""Military Revolutionary Committee\"" to actually carry out the seizure of power. It included eight (or nine) Russians, one Ukrainian, one Pole, one Caucasian, and six Jews.¬†Finally, to supervise the organization of the uprising, the Bolshevik Central Committee established a five-man \""Revolutionary Military Center\"" as the Party's operations command. It consisted of one Russian (Bubnov), one Georgian (Stalin), one Pole (Dzerzhinsky), and two Jews (Sverdlov and Uritsky).\n\nContemporary Voices of Warning\n\nWell-informed observers, both inside and outside of Russia, took note at the time of the crucial Jewish role in Bolshevism. Winston Churchill, for one, warned in an article published in the February 8, 1920, issue of the London¬†Illustrated Sunday Herald¬†that Bolshevism is a \""worldwide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality.\"" The eminent British political leader and historian went on to write:\n\nThere is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by these international and for the most part atheistical Jews. It is certainly a very great one; it probably outweighs all others. With the notable exception of Lenin, the majority of the leading figures are Jews. Moreover, the principal inspiration and driving power comes from the Jewish leaders. Thus Tchitcherin, a pure Russian, is eclipsed by his nominal subordinate, Litvinoff, and the influence of Russians like Bukharin or Lunacharski cannot be compared with the power of Trotsky, or of Zinovieff, the Dictator of the Red Citadel (Petrograd), or of Krassin or Radek -- all Jews. In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astonishing. And the prominent, if not indeed the principal, part in the system of terrorism applied by the Extraordinary Commissions for Combatting Counter-Revolution [the Cheka] has been taken by Jews, and in some notable cases by Jewesses.\n\nNeedless to say, the most intense passions of revenge have been excited in the breasts of the Russian people.\n\nDavid R. Francis, United States ambassador in Russia, warned in a January 1918 dispatch to Washington: \""The Bolshevik leaders here, most of whom are Jews and 90 percent of whom are returned exiles, care little for Russia or any other country but are internationalists and they are trying to start a worldwide social revolution.\""\n\nThe Netherlands' ambassador in Russia, Oudendyke, made much the same point a few months later: \""Unless Bolshevism is nipped in the bud immediately, it is bound to spread in one form or another over Europe and the whole world as it is organized and worked by Jews who have no nationality, and whose one object is to destroy for their own ends the existing order of things.\""\n\n\""The Bolshevik Revolution,\"" declared a leading American Jewish community paper in 1920, \""was largely the product of Jewish thinking, Jewish discontent, Jewish effort to reconstruct.\""\n\nAs an expression of its radically anti-nationalist character, the fledgling Soviet government issued a decree a few months after taking power that made anti-Semitism a crime in Russia. The new Communist regime thus became the first in the world to severely punish all expressions of anti-Jewish sentiment. Soviet officials apparently regarded such measures as indispensable. Based on careful observation during a lengthy stay in Russia, American-Jewish scholar Frank Golder reported in 1925 that \""because so many of the Soviet leaders are Jews anti-Semitism is gaining [in Russia], particularly in the army [and] among the old and new intelligentsia who are being crowded for positions by the sons of Israel.\""\n\nHistorians' Views\n\nSumming up the situation at that time, Israeli historian Louis Rapoport writes:\n\nImmediately after the [Bolshevik] Revolution, many Jews were euphoric over their high representation in the new government. Lenin's first Politburo was dominated by men of Jewish origins.\n\nUnder Lenin, Jews became involved in all aspects of the Revolution, including its dirtiest work. Despite the Communists' vows to eradicate anti-Semitism, it spread rapidly after the Revolution -- partly because of the prominence of so many Jews in the Soviet administration, as well as in the traumatic, inhuman Sovietization drives that followed. Historian Salo Baron has noted that an immensely disproportionate number of Jews joined the new Bolshevik secret police, the Cheka And many of those who fell afoul of the Cheka would be shot by Jewish investigators.\n\nThe collective leadership that emerged in Lenin's dying days was headed by the Jew Zinoviev, a loquacious, mean-spirited, curly-haired Adonis whose vanity knew no bounds.\n\n\""Anyone who had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the Cheka,\"" wrote Jewish historian Leonard Schapiro, \""stood a very good chance of finding himself confronted with, and possibly shot by, a Jewish investigator.\""¬†In Ukraine, \""Jews made up nearly 80 percent of the rank-and-file Cheka agents,\"" reports W. Bruce Lincoln, an American professor of Russian history.(Beginning as the¬†Cheka, or¬†Vecheka) the Soviet secret police was later known as the GPU, OGPU, NKVD, MVD and KGB.)\n\nIn light of all this, it should not be surprising that Yakov M. Yurovksy, the leader of the Bolshevik squad that carried out the murder of the Tsar and his family, was Jewish, as was Sverdlov, the Soviet chief who co-signed Lenin's execution order.\n\nIgor Shafarevich, a Russian mathematician of world stature, has sharply criticized the Jewish role in bringing down the Romanov monarchy and establishing Communist rule in his country. Shafarevich was a leading dissident during the final decades of Soviet rule. A prominent human rights activist, he was a founding member of the Committee on the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR.\n\nIn¬†Russophobia, a book written ten years before the collapse of Communist rule, he noted that Jews were \""amazingly\"" numerous among the personnel of the Bolshevik secret police. The characteristic Jewishness of the Bolshevik executioners, Shafarevich went on, is most conspicuous in the execution of Nicholas II"",
