Cut the ends at 45 degrees.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTie the ribbons as a sandwich, as if they were one ribbon.  Use a man’s tie, a half Windsor knot for the best look.  After it is tied on, the total length of the ribbons will be about 5 inches from the handle.  This is too short to catch on anything such as rollers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScissor cut trim the ribbons to cascading different lengths after they are tied.  Put a drop of Super Glue at the end. \u003cbr\u003eIf each ribbon is slightly a different length by 1/4” the color layers will all show up no matter how they drape.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see these ribbons from 40 feet away.  \u003cbr\u003ePerhaps tie TWO  handles or RINGS top and side of the case.  \u003cbr\u003eTie using a HALF WINDSOR KNOT to the metal buckle ring of the handle.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLearn Half Windsor knot tying:\u003cbr\u003eIt is the 2nd example in this video\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/X0yh5rKB9lE\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/X0yh5rKB9lE\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis knot does not loosen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePut your phone number on one ribbon using a fine point permanent Sharpie.  \u003cbr\u003eExample:  “Owner 454-333-7878”\u003cbr\u003eNo personal name necessary.\u003cbr\u003eNo address necessary on the ribbon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChoose one ribbon with an unusual pattern or fabric to really make it unique.

Example:  overhead compartment, unloaded from the bus, at the hotel lobby, at the airport turnstile...\n\nThese ribbons make your luggage different and EASY TO SPOT when the piece is surrounded by 35 other cases unloaded from the bus.  Using 4 ribbons make it immediately different than other cases with 1 ribbon.\n\nUse 1” wide ribbons 14” long and not longer.  Cut the ends at 45 degrees.\n\nTie the ribbons as a sandwich, as if they were one ribbon.  Use a man’s tie, a half Windsor knot for the best look.  After it is tied on, the total length of the ribbons will be about 5 inches from the handle.  This is too short to catch on anything such as rollers.\n\nScissor cut trim the ribbons to cascading different lengths after they are tied.  Put a drop of Super Glue at the end. \nIf each ribbon is slightly a different length by 1/4” the color layers will all show up no matter how they drape.  \n\nYou can see these ribbons from 40 feet away.  \nPerhaps tie TWO  handles or RINGS top and side of the case.  \nTie using a HALF WINDSOR KNOT to the metal buckle ring of the handle.  \n\nLearn Half Windsor knot tying:\nIt is the 2nd example in this video\nhttps://youtu.be/X0yh5rKB9lE\nThis knot does not loosen.\n\nPut your phone number on one ribbon using a fine point permanent Sharpie.  \nExample:  “Owner 454-333-7878”\nNo personal name necessary.\nNo address necessary on the ribbon.\n\nChoose one ribbon with an unusual pattern or fabric to really make it unique.

A moment later, the jetliner smashed into the concrete façade of the Pentagon and exploded as it disappeared into the wall. \""I saw it crash into the building,\"" said McGraw. \""There was an explosion and a loud noise, and I felt the impact.\"" (Bamford, 47-8). The bodies of Flight 77 passengers and crew, as well as Pentagon employees, would be painstakingly recovered from the rubble in the days and weeks that followed. With Langley's alert fighters over a hundred miles away, Andrews Air Force Base (situated just outside Washington) scrambled fighters \""weapons-free\"" to protect the capital at the request of the Secret Service. In fact, protecting the Washington DC area is part of the charter of the 113th Air National Guard Wing stationed at Andrews: \""as part of its dual mission, the 113th provides capable and ready response forces for the District of Columbia in the event of a natural disaster or civil emergency.\"" Why those fighters weren't launched sooner under the direction of NORAD has never been adequately explained....\n\nFull text available on Amazon: Waleed Higgins, Last Messages"",

In fact, Sully looked at this switch when he reached up to turn on the APU (Auxillary Power Unit) after both of the jet engines flamed out from the bird impacts - and with a potential water-landing looming, Sully had the most prominent reminder of the Ditch Switch literally staring him right in the face when he reached up to switch on the APU. The Ditch Switch, when turned on - seals the pressure-equalizing vents in the cabin floor to prevent water that could flood the baggage section below the cabin floor after a water landing - from entering the cabin in the event of an emergency landing on water.  And even though all of the passengers were safely evacuated in this incident - it would have been a lot less traumatic on them if there wasn&#39;t any inrushing of ice-cold water into the passenger cabin after the ditching - which again, could have been prevented by simply turning on the Ditch Switch prior to the ditching. This simple but very vital action should have been foremost on the minds of Sully and his co-pilot in their preparation for the water landing - and if they were 100% on top of their game - they wouldn&#39;t have forgotten to turn this switch on prior to the water landing.  But neither one of them thought to perform this important action, which is something that should have been so well ingrained into their minds as pilots Type-Rated on the A-320, that it should not have required reading it on a checklist to prompt them to do it.  Pilots receive specific and intensive &quot;Type-Rating&quot; training on each aircraft that they are certified to fly, and through this special training, they are familiarized with every aspect of the aircraft in which they earn a Type-Rating on.  The Type-Rating training on the Airbus A-320 covers the purpose and functionality of the Ditch Switch - and this is something that every pilot trained on the A-320 should have &quot;burned into their minds&quot; to the point where they would &quot;automatically&quot; know to flip this switch on prior to an emergency water landing - without having to be reminded to do it by reading a checklist.  Pilot Proficiency is all about thoroughly learning, knowing and mastering every operational feature and aspect of each and every aircraft that a pilot is certified to fly and in this particular instance, there was an ominous lacking in proficiency on behalf of both pilots in their  failure to turn on the Ditch Switch before landing their A-320 in the Hudson River.  But despite this lacking of proficiency,  the overall outcome was still exceptional as the crew did get everything else done very well and everyone on board survived.  It would have been a perfect scenario without the ice-cold water rushing into the cabin - a problem that was made even worse than it should have been - not only by the crew&#39;s failure to turn on the Ditch Switch before the belly-landing on the waterbut also after the ditching when a passenger - who didn&#39;t pay attention to the pre-flight safety briefing - opened one of the doors in the rear of the  aircraft, causing water to flood into the cabin.  The safety-information cards in each seatback pocket (which the passengers are informed about during the pre-flight safety briefing) clearly state not to open the rear emergency escape doors in the event of a water landing - because the tail of the plane will settle too deeply into the water to allow the rear emergency doors to be safely opened without flooding the cabin with water.  Here again is a shortcoming of the flight crew and in this case  - it was the flight attendants - who after the ditching failed to emphatically warn the passengers who were sitting by the rear emergency escape doors not to open those doors."",

I am only 5&#39;6&quot; but I&#39;ve had problems getting my legs to fit. The seat was 19.6&quot; and that was plenty of room for me. if a person is overweight than the person should make arrangements for a larger seat or buy two seats in order not to be embarassed at the counter. What I resent is that seats are getting smaller. Seats are 1 1.5 to 2 inches smaller than they used to be. I believe seats need to be the size they used to be. Also very few people would take up two seats. I need an inch or two extra so I think seats could be sold at small, medium and large--say $75 for small, $100 for medium and $125 for large. A normal sized person or petite person could buy a large seat for more room if they want. As far as profit lost with wider seats--I mean seats as wide as they used to be the airlines make lots of profit now. They charge $25 for a suitcase. Some charge for a carry on and charge to put items in the overhead bin. They charge for lunch. Even as a person of size I won&#39;t buy lunch--yuk! Weight discrimination?
