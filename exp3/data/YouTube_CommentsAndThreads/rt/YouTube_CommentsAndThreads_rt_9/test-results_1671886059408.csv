(D)No one comes to the Father (E)except through Me.\n\n*Did you know you’re part of the ultimate statistics, 10 out of 10 people die. One day your heart will stop beating and you will be dead! The Bible says you’ll then be judged by the holy and righteous God who created this universe.(Hebrew 9:27)You’ll be judged for every word, thought, and action in your life.(Matthew 12:36-37) Will you be innocent or guilty?\n\n*Let’s check the standard, the Ten Commandments. Have you ever lied (even a “white” lie)? (Revelation 21:8) Have you ever stolen anything (value is irrelevant and includes downloading or copying movies illegally)?  If you’ve lusted, you’ve committed adultery in your heart. (Matthew 5:27-30) (1 Corinthians 6:9-10)\n\nIf you’ve hated someone, the Bible says you’re a murderer(1 John 3:15). If you’ve done any of these things, you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. God is perfect and He hates sinbut He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the Cross to take the punishment you deserve. Then He rose from the graves after three days  – defeating death. (Luke 24:46-48)\n\nRepent (turn from your sins) and trust in Jesus Christ our Lord and saviour  to receive forgiveness and everlasting life afterlife here on earth without pain, suffering and death anymore (revelation 21:4) God cannot Lie He is holy, Righteous and just cannot tolerate Sin(Hebrew 6:18) if you don’t believe in God you are making God a liar. Think about it.\n\nDo you think God cannot preserve His words ? He created the heaven and the earth and the sea all living things here on earth including human.\n\n. Read the Bible to learn about God and how to live. (Acts 20:21) \n\n*Do God’s will, plan and purpose in your life; these are above and beyond, immeasurable compare to your grandest dream.\n\n* We obey God’s moral law the Ten Commandments because we love our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ, the Father and the Holy Ghost(John 14:15) (John 14:1-6) (John 14:16-26) (Mark 12:30-31)  with all our heart, soul, mind and all our strength, and we believe and have faith in Him; also we Fear Him with reverence with deep respect. \n\nJob 28:28\nKing James Version\n28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.\n\n1 Corinthians 6:9-10\nNew King James Version\n9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. (A)Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor [a]homosexuals, nor [b]sodomites, 10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.\n\nEcclesiastes 12:13-14\nNew King James Version\n13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter:\n\n(A)Fear God and keep His commandments,\nFor this is man’s all.\n14 For (B)God will bring every work into judgment,\nIncluding every secret thing,\nWhether good or evil.\n\n* Let’s seek the Lord and His face also His strength, power, wisdom and discernment in our daily lives.\n\nWe need God’s help to overcome Sin in our lives. And live a holy life in the eyes of the Living God. \n\nGod will help us if we seek Him diligently with all our heart, soul, mind and all our strength .\n\nPut on always the full armour of God (Ephesians 6:10-18)\n\nPhilippians 4:13\nNew King James Version\n13 I can do all things (A)through [a]Christ who strengthens me.\n\nPsalm 28:7\nNew King James Version\n7 The Lord is (A)my strength and my shield;\nMy heart (B)trusted in Him, and I am helped;\nTherefore my heart greatly rejoices,\nAnd with my song I will praise Him.\n\nActs 20:21\nKing James Version\n21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nGod bless.\n\n\nLiving water.,.."",

They almost certainly don&#39;t know why it happened. Most probably don&#39;t even know who did it. Such things aren&#39;t taught in schools now. So here&#39;s what took place on that fateful Tuesday, what the United States of America did about it, and why it&#39;s one of the most important days in American history.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSeptember 11, 2001 began as a beautiful morning on the East Coast. America was at peace—not embroiled in any foreign war. Passengers boarded their early flights, headed to business meetings or to visit relatives across the country. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTragically, they were not the only ones who boarded planes that morning. Nineteen Islamic terrorists, organized by the terrorist group that calls itself al-Qaeda, directed by its leader, Osama bin Laden, and drawn from four Arab countries, also boarded planes that morning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the planes—the terrorists were split among 4 of them—were cross-country flights, so their tanks were filled to capacity with jet fuel. Within an hour after takeoff, these 19 terrorists would hijack the planes, brutally murder defenseless stewardesses and pilots, and kill 3,000 innocent people.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt 8:46 a.m., a hijacked American Airlines flight leaving Boston crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, the international symbol of America&#39;s economic power. Seventeen minutes later, a second hijacked plane, also departing from Boston, crashed into the World Trade Center&#39;s South Tower. The two planes, spewing their jet fuel, ignited fires that burned hot enough to compromise the buildings&#39; structural integrity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHundreds of New York firefighters and police officers raced up the towers to rescue the victims. Quite suddenly, the buildings collapsed, killing 343 firefighters, 60 police officers, and thousands of trapped office workers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA third hijacked plane, leaving Washington&#39;s Dulles Airport, crashed into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. military; 125 Pentagon workers were killed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe passengers of a fourth hijacked plane—this one leaving Newark International Airport shortly after the others—had just enough time to learn, via their cell phones, of the other attacks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose onboard decided that the nightmare would stop with them. Unarmed, with no hope of survival, they fought the terrorists, crashing the plane in an empty field in Pennsylvania. They gave their lives so that more Americans would not die. We learned later that this plane, United Airlines flight 93, had been heading for either the White House or U.S. Capitol.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Islamic terrorists who launched these attacks made a number of claims about their motivations. But here is the truth: They did not murder thousands of Americans because they disagreed with America&#39;s Middle East policy. And they certainly didn&#39;t do it because they were poor and hopeless; they were all either from wealthy or middle-class Arab families. They attacked America because they despised its values—most especially its freedom and tolerance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe United States, as the guardian of freedom in the West, had to be brought down. This attack would start that process. It would show the world that America was weak—that America lacked the will to safeguard its liberties and people. Bin Laden called America a &quot;paper tiger.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the days immediately after the attacks, the terrorist leader and his many supporters in the Muslim Middle East believed he had proved his point. Mothers across the Muslim world named their babies &quot;Osama;&quot; bin Laden&#39;s face adorned posters in homes; and kids in Pakistan wore bin Laden t-shirts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut on the afternoon of September 14th, President George W. Bush visited the twisted, still-smoldering wreckage of &quot;Ground Zero&quot;—where the Twin Towers had stood—and, megaphone in hand, promised that America would not be cowed:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;I can hear you,&quot; he said. &quot;The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear from all of us soon.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd they did. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmerica launched its War on Terror, destroyed the terrorist leadership, and sent bin Laden into a decade of running and hiding. Within six months, kids in Pakistan were no longer wearing bin Laden t-shirts. And ten years later, the CIA located and a team of Navy SEALS killed the terrorist leader.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmerica will always have her enemies.

Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis much we pledge--and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends.

Kennedy&#39;s Inaugural Address (1961)\u003cbr\u003eprint-friendly version\u003cbr\u003eVice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, Reverend Clergy, fellow citizens:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom--symbolizing an end as well as a beginning--signifying renewal as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forbears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe--the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis much we pledge--and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided there is little we can do--for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom--and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required--not because the communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votesbut because it is right.

            ""textOriginal"": ""Transcript of President John F. Kennedy's Inaugural Address (1961)\nprint-friendly version\nVice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, Reverend Clergy, fellow citizens:\n\nWe observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom--symbolizing an end as well as a beginning--signifying renewal as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forbears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.\n\nThe world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe--the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.\n\nWe dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.\n\nLet every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\n\nThis much we pledge--and more.\n\nTo those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided there is little we can do--for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.\n\nTo those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom--and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.\n\nTo those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required--not because the communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votesbut because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.\n\nTo our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge--to convert our good words into good deeds--in a new alliance for progress--to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty. But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. And let every other power know that this Hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house.\n\nTo that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support--to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective--to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak--and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.\n\nFinally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\n\nWe dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\n\nBut neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course--both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war.\n\nSo let us begin anew--remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.\n\nLet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.\n\nLet both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms--and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.\n\nLet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors.

Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.\n\nIn your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course.

The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.\n\nNow the trumpet summons us again--not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need--not as a call to battle, though embattled we are-- but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, \""rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation\""--a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself.\n\nCan we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?

I have a very good, trusted and reliable courier contact used mostly by our forces in Jordan, that can send goods easily through a private military way, to anywhere in the world, without them being checked at any port of entry.

Razumkov and deputies of this legislative body.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe appeals state in particular,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“We, participants in the congress of representatives of the captured parishes of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (hereafter UOC), appeal to you to defend the greatest value - our life, our health and security as well as those of our families.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe appeal to you on behalf of those faithful of our Church who have suffered a severe bodily harm such as punches in heads, broken arms, beating. We also appeal to you on behalf of many clergy who are continuously and groundlessly summoned for interrogation at law-enforcement bodies and humiliated in every way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe appeal to you on behalf of the family of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church’s priest Leonid Delikatny, whose health has been irreparably undermined by continuous threats, blackmail and psychological pressure in attempts to transfer forcibly the community he leads to a different confession.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe appeal to you on behalf of Kristina Velushchak, a young woman from the Chernovtsy Region, who was barred from her own school graduation party because of attending ‘a wrong Church’, as well as other UOC parishioners suffering from restrictions of their civil rights because of their faith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also appeal to you on behalf of large families of the UOC priests who have been driven out of their homes into streets thus making small children homeless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe appeal to you on behalf of ordinary people from all parts of Ukraine who forcibly or deceivingly (through illegitimate re-registration of parish statutes by regional state administrations) have been deprived or subjected to attempts to deprive them of their churches to which their grandfathers and great-grandfathers used to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe point out that as the largest religious community in Ukraine we, unfortunately, are losing hope that our rights to freedom of faith will be ensured by the state power bodies and their leaders. The law in force, which should regulate religious legal relationships in a state, quite the contrary, reinforces the split in society, divide people into ones’ own and others’, which leads to a growing number of inter-confessional confrontations and aggravation of religious enmity and conflicts in the state - thus, the 17.01.2019 Ukrainian Law No. 2673-VIII ‘On the Amendments to Certain Laws of Ukraine Concerning Subordination of Religious Organizations and Procedure for State Registration of Religious Organizations with Status of Legal Entity’ and the 20.12.2018 Ukrainian Law No. 2662-VIII ‘On the Amendments to Article 12 of the Ukrainian Law On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations’ concerning the designation of religious organizations (associations), included in the structure (are parts) of a religious organization (association) whose center (administration) is located outside Ukraine in a state recognized by law as that which carried out an aggression against Ukraine and/or has temporarily occupied a part of the territory of Ukraine  - the laws that gravely violate the constitutional principle of the separation of state from church.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe express our profound concern for that fact that in recent years the Ukrainian Minister of Culture by way of abuse and manipulation has used these anti-constitutional laws exclusively against the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and coercively sought to deprive her if her own name. Officials have violated the principle of equality of all religious confessions and restricted the rights of one religious organization among others, which is discrimination on religious grounds of millions of believers who belong to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The state bodies, by interfering in the internal affairs of the Church, have imposed their own understanding of her religious and hierarchal structure. There are violations of the Ukrainian Constitution provisions that exclude the possibility for establishing special requirements for designating particular religious organizations and regulate the right of each to profess any religion. That is why, the UOC religious communities are subject to continuous pressure coming from state authorities and raiders; we have been deprived of the possibility to introduce amendments to the constituent documents, to use notary services, to register officially the rights to plots of land under church buildings, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome pseudo-religious organizations have regularly carried out provocative actions causing destabilization in Ukrainian society. In the mass media and internet space, false information is given about religious events, which discredit the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. There are an increased number of criminal offences committed on religious grounds and litigations for appealing the acts of state authorities, etc. The use of anti-constitutional laws by church raiders leads to the deterioration of the level of freedom of faith in Ukraine, to the creation of considerable obstacles for the religious and social service of churches and religious organizations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe law on the coercive change of the designation and subordination is not correspondent with either the Ukrainian Constitution or international agreements on human rights. In particular, the norms of laws contradict provisions of the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with regard to the protection of the right to freedom of faith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe UOC religious communities have found themselves in an unequal situation as compared to other religious organizations in Ukraine. The forceful re-registration, the change in the name of religious organizations (associations) and subordination in canonical matters is a direct interference in freedom of faith. The right to the autonomy of religious organizations is guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and reflected in numerous decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. A religious organization has the right to choose its name on its own and the state has no right to coerce it into changing it. These laws directly violate Article 35 of the Ukrainian Constitution, Article 9 of the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Article 18 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 18 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAppealing to the head of State V. A. Zelensky, the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church who attended the congress underlined, “Dear Mr. President, we, the people, citizens of the unified state of Ukraine, are deeply concerned over the fact that the state policy currently in force is directed against millions of believing citizens who belong to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. We all are Ukrainians, true patriots who love and respect their native land; we work in good faith, treat the ill, fulfil in good faith the military duty, pay taxes and develop various spheres of public life. The Church has never divided and will never divide her faithful according to their origin, social status, ethnicity, language or political preferences. Political preferences and contradictions should not separate parents from children, should not divide married couples, friends or fellow workers. Politics should not sow thorns of hate and anger in our hearts. The preservation of public peace and tranquility in the vortex of today’s events and pandemics is our common duty”.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey have called the president to use his powers provided by Ukrainian law and to take urgent effective measures to protect the constitutional rights of believing citizens who belong to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and to introduce to the Ukrainian Supreme Rada as a legislative initiative a bill that will cancel Ukrainian Law No. 2673-VIII and Ukrainian Law No. 2662-VIII (which, along with the things causing the violation of the constitutional rights and freedoms of Ukrainian citizens, bear a threat to the authority of our state on the international scene, challenge the sincerity of the Euro-integrational aspirations proclaimed by Ukraine, the realization of which is impossible in a situation of human rights and freedom violations and especially the rights of vulnerable sections of the population to which believers belongs).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey made similar appeals to the speaker and members of the Supreme Rada and to the prime minister.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe participants in the congress of representatives of captured churches also asked D. A. Shmygal to introduce a moratorium on any registration action to change confessional affiliation and forceful re-naming of religious communities of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church before amendments are made to the Ukrainian Law ‘On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations’.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe appeals to Ukrainian state officials are concluded with calls to ‘unite efforts and resources in order to create equal and safe conditions for life in Ukraine and to eradicate any form of violence towards believers’.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDECR Communication Service/\u003ca href=\""http://patriarchia.ru/\""\u003ePatriarchia.ru\u003c/a\u003e"",

The law in force, which should regulate religious legal relationships in a state, quite the contrary, reinforces the split in society, divide people into ones’ own and others’, which leads to a growing number of inter-confessional confrontations and aggravation of religious enmity and conflicts in the state - thus, the 17.01.2019 Ukrainian Law No. 2673-VIII ‘On the Amendments to Certain Laws of Ukraine Concerning Subordination of Religious Organizations and Procedure for State Registration of Religious Organizations with Status of Legal Entity’ and the 20.12.2018 Ukrainian Law No. 2662-VIII ‘On the Amendments to Article 12 of the Ukrainian Law On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations’ concerning the designation of religious organizations (associations), included in the structure (are parts) of a religious organization (association) whose center (administration) is located outside Ukraine in a state recognized by law as that which carried out an aggression against Ukraine and/or has temporarily occupied a part of the territory of Ukraine  - the laws that gravely violate the constitutional principle of the separation of state from church.\n\nWe express our profound concern for that fact that in recent years the Ukrainian Minister of Culture by way of abuse and manipulation has used these anti-constitutional laws exclusively against the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and coercively sought to deprive her if her own name. Officials have violated the principle of equality of all religious confessions and restricted the rights of one religious organization among others, which is discrimination on religious grounds of millions of believers who belong to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The state bodies, by interfering in the internal affairs of the Church, have imposed their own understanding of her religious and hierarchal structure. There are violations of the Ukrainian Constitution provisions that exclude the possibility for establishing special requirements for designating particular religious organizations and regulate the right of each to profess any religion. That is why, the UOC religious communities are subject to continuous pressure coming from state authorities and raiders; we have been deprived of the possibility to introduce amendments to the constituent documents, to use notary services, to register officially the rights to plots of land under church buildings, etc.\n\nSome pseudo-religious organizations have regularly carried out provocative actions causing destabilization in Ukrainian society. In the mass media and internet space, false information is given about religious events, which discredit the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. There are an increased number of criminal offences committed on religious grounds and litigations for appealing the acts of state authorities, etc. The use of anti-constitutional laws by church raiders leads to the deterioration of the level of freedom of faith in Ukraine, to the creation of considerable obstacles for the religious and social service of churches and religious organizations.\n\nThe law on the coercive change of the designation and subordination is not correspondent with either the Ukrainian Constitution or international agreements on human rights. In particular, the norms of laws contradict provisions of the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with regard to the protection of the right to freedom of faith.\n\nThe UOC religious communities have found themselves in an unequal situation as compared to other religious organizations in Ukraine. The forceful re-registration, the change in the name of religious organizations (associations) and subordination in canonical matters is a direct interference in freedom of faith. The right to the autonomy of religious organizations is guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and reflected in numerous decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. A religious organization has the right to choose its name on its own and the state has no right to coerce it into changing it. These laws directly violate Article 35 of the Ukrainian Constitution, Article 9 of the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Article 18 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 18 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nAppealing to the head of State V. A. Zelensky, the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church who attended the congress underlined, “Dear Mr. President, we, the people, citizens of the unified state of Ukraine, are deeply concerned over the fact that the state policy currently in force is directed against millions of believing citizens who belong to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. We all are Ukrainians, true patriots who love and respect their native land; we work in good faith, treat the ill, fulfil in good faith the military duty, pay taxes and develop various spheres of public life. The Church has never divided and will never divide her faithful according to their origin, social status, ethnicity, language or political preferences. Political preferences and contradictions should not separate parents from children, should not divide married couples, friends or fellow workers. Politics should not sow thorns of hate and anger in our hearts. The preservation of public peace and tranquility in the vortex of today’s events and pandemics is our common duty”.\n\nThey have called the president to use his powers provided by Ukrainian law and to take urgent effective measures to protect the constitutional rights of believing citizens who belong to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and to introduce to the Ukrainian Supreme Rada as a legislative initiative a bill that will cancel Ukrainian Law No. 2673-VIII and Ukrainian Law No. 2662-VIII (which, along with the things causing the violation of the constitutional rights and freedoms of Ukrainian citizens, bear a threat to the authority of our state on the international scene, challenge the sincerity of the Euro-integrational aspirations proclaimed by Ukraine, the realization of which is impossible in a situation of human rights and freedom violations and especially the rights of vulnerable sections of the population to which believers belongs).\n\nThey made similar appeals to the speaker and members of the Supreme Rada and to the prime minister.\n\nThe participants in the congress of representatives of captured churches also asked D. A. Shmygal to introduce a moratorium on any registration action to change confessional affiliation and forceful re-naming of religious communities of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church before amendments are made to the Ukrainian Law ‘On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations’.\n\nThe appeals to Ukrainian state officials are concluded with calls to ‘unite efforts and resources in order to create equal and safe conditions for life in Ukraine and to eradicate any form of violence towards believers’.\n\nDECR Communication Service/Patriarchia.ru"",
