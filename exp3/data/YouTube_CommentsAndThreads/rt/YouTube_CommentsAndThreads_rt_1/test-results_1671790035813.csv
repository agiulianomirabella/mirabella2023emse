Meanwhile all this, BTS writes/records music, dance practices, has shootings, prepares for comeback, promotions, fansigns, rehearses for world tours etc. There’s a legit reason why BTS multiple times has won ”Top Social Artist” at BBMA, and ”Favorite Social Artist” at AMA. Unlike predjudice, it’s not ”crazy” Armys voting without reason. BTS deserves their ”Social” wins.

              ""textDisplay"": ""Part 5 of 7:\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eOn their studio albums, nor when performing live, BTS has never used back-up singers. So when performing live, a member sometimes complements his live vocals with subtle a backtrack in tough choreo parts. Sadly some antis get backtrack vocals mixed up with lip-syncing which is unfair and totally not the same!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWestern award shows/TV shows have multiple times muted the Army fanchants, which also sadly have muted/toned down the voices of BTS. Compared to other artists’ performances, these shows have been criticized for focusing more screentime on the audience’s reactions, than BTS on stage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJimin is a rare counter tenor which is a male singing voice equivalent to a female contralto or mezzo-soprano. He has the highest pitch voice and can hit very high notes. He’s considered to have one of the most unique voices. Fatima from ”USA Today” tweeted: ”Jimin has one of the most unique &amp; amazing vocals I’ve ever heard in the entire music industry. It can be smooth &amp; sweet but also rough &amp; raspy in the best way, &amp; he exhibits emotions thru it so beautifully”. Jimin has said he can get very nervous on stage. Since he is a perfectionist and hard on himself, there’s been times he’s shed tears (onstage and backstage) when his voice has cracked. Antis have unfairly accused him that he can’t sing. Look at his 18-year old impressive vocals in ”Let me know” 2014, which was written, produced and directed by Suga\u003cbr\u003e \u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/fgyLhECCZlE\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/fgyLhECCZlE\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/iUHMrVQrkHM\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/iUHMrVQrkHM\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eJin is a wonderful natural tenor and together with Jimin he have the highest vocal notes, that’s rare for males. Because of this he said it was hard for him to sing in ”Blue and Grey” written by V to fit his lower, darker voice. \u003cbr\u003eJk is a tenor and is considered to be the best singer in S.Korea. He sings effortlessly and has an incredible vocal range. JK showcases this in adlibs and many songs like in his bridge in ”ON”. V is a baritone with a characteristic, darker, charismatic voicebut as the others he can sing really high notes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBTS is natural, humble, open-minded and have spoken up about subjects as mental health, depression, self-love, gender-identity, youth issues, social society pressures, life, love, dreams etc. They’re well-spoken in their native Korean tongue. In English interviews the language barrier makes it difficult to express themselves with the words they’d like to. RM who’s the best in English is the group’s ”spokesperson”. However, the other members have improved their English through the years. Sometimes they in advance practice phrases that they want to say. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen new International fans get to know BTS, they naturally learn more about the S.Korean culture. In general it’s more common for males to have physical contact, skinship, being touchy-feely and show softer emotional sides of themselves to the audience. That’s one reason why there’re alot of ”couple ships” with the members by their fans. But whatever relationship some members might have, real Army would always support them no matter what. There’re different couple constellations (both as couple and as friends) with all members. One loved trio is Jinjikook (Jin, Jimin, Jungkook). Jin the oldest has always been loved together with the maknae-line. It’s also more common for guys to care about skin routines. On their trips/vaccays we’ve seen members putting on their face cream and their selfies with face mask sheets on etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother difference is how they dress up and appear on stage and have broken gender barrieres. They’ve shown a variety of styles (hair, make-up clothes, accessories) that have always matched the themes of their songs.

(After collab with Halsey, BTS gifted her with her own glittery mic). To some non-Koreans all this can be seen as somewhat ”feminine”.

In 2021, BTS joined Louis Vuitton as Official House Ambassadors.

              ""textOriginal"": ""Part 5 of 7:\n \nOn their studio albums, nor when performing live, BTS has never used back-up singers. So when performing live, a member sometimes complements his live vocals with subtle a backtrack in tough choreo parts. Sadly some antis get backtrack vocals mixed up with lip-syncing which is unfair and totally not the same!\n\nWestern award shows/TV shows have multiple times muted the Army fanchants, which also sadly have muted/toned down the voices of BTS. Compared to other artists’ performances, these shows have been criticized for focusing more screentime on the audience’s reactions, than BTS on stage.\n\nJimin is a rare counter tenor which is a male singing voice equivalent to a female contralto or mezzo-soprano. He has the highest pitch voice and can hit very high notes. He’s considered to have one of the most unique voices. Fatima from ”USA Today” tweeted: ”Jimin has one of the most unique & amazing vocals I’ve ever heard in the entire music industry. It can be smooth & sweet but also rough & raspy in the best way, & he exhibits emotions thru it so beautifully”. Jimin has said he can get very nervous on stage. Since he is a perfectionist and hard on himself, there’s been times he’s shed tears (onstage and backstage) when his voice has cracked. Antis have unfairly accused him that he can’t sing. Look at his 18-year old impressive vocals in ”Let me know” 2014, which was written, produced and directed by Suga\n https://youtu.be/fgyLhECCZlE\nhttps://youtu.be/iUHMrVQrkHM \nJin is a wonderful natural tenor and together with Jimin he have the highest vocal notes, that’s rare for males. Because of this he said it was hard for him to sing in ”Blue and Grey” written by V to fit his lower, darker voice. \nJk is a tenor and is considered to be the best singer in S.Korea. He sings effortlessly and has an incredible vocal range. JK showcases this in adlibs and many songs like in his bridge in ”ON”. V is a baritone with a characteristic, darker, charismatic voicebut as the others he can sing really high notes. \n\nBTS is natural, humble, open-minded and have spoken up about subjects as mental health, depression, self-love, gender-identity, youth issues, social society pressures, life, love, dreams etc. They’re well-spoken in their native Korean tongue. In English interviews the language barrier makes it difficult to express themselves with the words they’d like to. RM who’s the best in English is the group’s ”spokesperson”. However, the other members have improved their English through the years. Sometimes they in advance practice phrases that they want to say. \n\nWhen new International fans get to know BTS, they naturally learn more about the S.Korean culture. In general it’s more common for males to have physical contact, skinship, being touchy-feely and show softer emotional sides of themselves to the audience. That’s one reason why there’re alot of ”couple ships” with the members by their fans. But whatever relationship some members might have, real Army would always support them no matter what. There’re different couple constellations (both as couple and as friends) with all members. One loved trio is Jinjikook (Jin, Jimin, Jungkook). Jin the oldest has always been loved together with the maknae-line. It’s also more common for guys to care about skin routines. On their trips/vaccays we’ve seen members putting on their face cream and their selfies with face mask sheets on etc. \n\nAnother difference is how they dress up and appear on stage and have broken gender barrieres. They’ve shown a variety of styles (hair, make-up clothes, accessories) that have always matched the themes of their songs. Off stage privately the members have their individual great fashion style taste and taste. However all members have dyed their hair in all kinds of colors, wear jewellry, accessories, handbags etc. Since pre-debute 5 of 7 members have earpearcings and some have several tattoos, like JK and Jimin. \nAll members have their own customized glittery microphone in the colour they’ve chosen themselves, along with matching earpieces. (After collab with Halsey, BTS gifted her with her own glittery mic). To some non-Koreans all this can be seen as somewhat ”feminine”. Globally this is one of the beauties of BTS and makes them special as they’ve unintentionally broken stereotypes and challenged traditional masculinity. In 2021, BTS joined Louis Vuitton as Official House Ambassadors. LV house tweeted: ”the world renowned Pop Icons are recognised for their uplifting messages that impart a positive influence”, and in a press release: ”BTS is one of the most renowned and influential groups in the world”. \n\nBTS was the first artist of a project to create new cartoon characters for the Korean ”Line Friends”-series.

Agus = Suga backwards, and ”t D” is derived from his birthplace town Daegu. Before BTS, he was part of an underground rap group named D-Town. This is his awesome ”Daechwita” MV: \u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/qGjAWJ2zWWI\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/qGjAWJ2zWWI\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNothing of the above was ever the case with those past big Western boybands before BTS. They always got their same, similiar trivial pop-songs written for them, and all these had the same(!) songwriters, producers, label. Their music are still being played by Western radio, whereas BTS has been non-existent. In comparison to BTS they lacked dancing skills or couldn’t dance at all, without having better vocals. \u003cbr\u003eUsually a group/artist is good at one thingbut BTS isn’t only the best idol dancers in the music industry, they’re just as incredible rappers and singers. Moreover they’re producers, composers, songwriters. Their charisma and stage presence are outstanding, which is very obvious when watching other groups/artists perform. Their duality off-stage from normal guys to these confident, captivating performers on-stage is fascinating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJin is born in Gwacheon and has an older brother. He has a major in acting and wanted to become an actor. He was street-scouted on a bus as a teenager because of his good looks, and had no experience in singing or dancing. He was trained from scratch and through hard work became a wonderful vocalist and dancer. In the beginning some said he and RM were the least good dancers of BTS. But we must be fair and remember that some of the other members are the best dancers in the industry, and BTS has always been known for their tough choreo. That says alot about how amazing Jin and RM really are. They’d be outstanding in many other groups. At debute Jin got to be the visual of BTS, and Army nicknamed him ”World-wide-handsome”. He makes his famous hand-blow-kisses and is known for his daddy-jokes. He is great at and enjoys computer games, snowboarding, fishing and goes mostly with Suga since both have few friends they hang out with. Jin is quite shy and has mentioned he’s got no friends, besides his 7 dongsaengs = younger brothers of BTS who’re his family. Jin said: ”We’re together like 360 out of 365 days”. \u003cbr\u003eJust as J-Hope he is known for being a ”scaredy-cat”, gets scared easily. The members have been together almost 24/7 for 10 years and are like an ”old married couple”.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eV is born in Daegu and has a younger sister and younger brother. He lived with his grandmother for many years who passed away which he cryingly revealed on stage some years ago. He was 15 when he joined BigHit and also got to be the visual. He got known for his dorky side and goofy sense of humour. Fans has also said that he looked like a pretty anime characther. He is great in basketboll and learns new choreo quickly. He has a dog named Yeontan ”Tannie” who is well-known among Army and has appeared in tweets and BTS Bombs. In 2016 V starred in the Korean TV-drama ”Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth”. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJ-Hope is born in Gwangju has an older sister Jiwoo. He is called ”the sunshine” of the group because of his sparky, energetic and enthusiastic nature, and has close to his loud, cheerful laughter. He can both rap and sing, and although RM and Suga are awesome in both ”classic” and ”melodic” rap, and can sing too, J-Hope is the best singer of the rapline. He was a dancer before BTS and is one of the group’s best dancers. He is their dance leader and in main charge of the choreography for BTS. They also got choreographer Son Sungdeuk who’ve been with them for a long time. J-Hope has a dog Mickey. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eJimin is born in Busan (just as JK) and has a younger brother Jihyun. The members have said that Jimin has a special aura about him, and is the cutest, most charming in the team: \u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/QHtRqopj3JI\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/QHtRqopj3JI\u003c/a\u003e  He has a friendly, likable personality and is very funny: \u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/7nvkf6lRtZg\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/7nvkf6lRtZg\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eHe is known for his androgynous attractive looks, and for being ”lovely, sexy and cute”. There’s a saying: ”Once u JimIN, u can’t JimOUT”. Some nicknames are ”Chimchim”, ”Minnie”, ”Mochi”, ”Mangetteok”(sticky ricecake), the last two he got in the beginning because he had his cute, milky, round, babyfat cheeks/face.\u003cbr\u003eIn school Jimin was excellent in both sports and academics, and was the ”Class President”. Above all, Jimin was legendary, an absolute top student at ”Busan Highschool of Arts” and was majoring in the modern/contemporary Dance department. He was (and still is) exceptional and entered at the top of his class, including all students of both genders and in all majors (Dance, Music, Arts). Normally students majoring in Music or Arts enter at the top, so it’s very rare for a Dance-majoring student to enter at the top. Jimin could’ve had a successful International career. At one of his teacher’s wedding, he got to do a solo dance performance. During middle school he attended a Dance Academy and learned popping and locking dance, and was winning street-dance battles in Busan. A young pre-debute Jimin: \u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/wPywFydPOS0\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/wPywFydPOS0\u003c/a\u003e  \u003cbr\u003eHis WIDE RANGE and brilliance in different genres (not only one), from hiphop to contemporary and classical ballet etc is astounding. He is one of the best dancers in the world, and definitely the best artist/idol dancer we’ve ever seen. Jimin is known for his perfect lines, impressive flexibility, prominent moves and extraordinary fluidity and smoothness. He is also known for his fascinating duality on and off stage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJimin has also studied different kinds of martial arts like Kendo, and had a black belt in Taekwondo. K-media wrote; ”Basketball, jump rope.. What can’t he do? Besides being an entertainment god with a natural sense of entertainment, he’s also outstanding athleticism”.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJimin 21, is opening ”SBS Gayo Daejun 2016” with other pro-dancers and K-artists:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/bXN_TZyycYk\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/bXN_TZyycYk\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/vdOQsDO1gjA\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/vdOQsDO1gjA\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a dancer myself, I don’t think general people understand the strength and control Jimin has, and sadly never will.

              ""textOriginal"": ""Part 4 of 7:\n\nFor Suga’s 2016 mixtape, he adopted the alias Agust D. Agus = Suga backwards, and ”t D” is derived from his birthplace town Daegu. Before BTS, he was part of an underground rap group named D-Town. This is his awesome ”Daechwita” MV: https://youtu.be/qGjAWJ2zWWI\n\nNothing of the above was ever the case with those past big Western boybands before BTS. They always got their same, similiar trivial pop-songs written for them, and all these had the same(!) songwriters, producers, label. Their music are still being played by Western radio, whereas BTS has been non-existent. In comparison to BTS they lacked dancing skills or couldn’t dance at all, without having better vocals. \nUsually a group/artist is good at one thingbut BTS isn’t only the best idol dancers in the music industry, they’re just as incredible rappers and singers. Moreover they’re producers, composers, songwriters. Their charisma and stage presence are outstanding, which is very obvious when watching other groups/artists perform. Their duality off-stage from normal guys to these confident, captivating performers on-stage is fascinating.\n\nJin is born in Gwacheon and has an older brother. He has a major in acting and wanted to become an actor. He was street-scouted on a bus as a teenager because of his good looks, and had no experience in singing or dancing. He was trained from scratch and through hard work became a wonderful vocalist and dancer. In the beginning some said he and RM were the least good dancers of BTS. But we must be fair and remember that some of the other members are the best dancers in the industry, and BTS has always been known for their tough choreo. That says alot about how amazing Jin and RM really are. They’d be outstanding in many other groups. At debute Jin got to be the visual of BTS, and Army nicknamed him ”World-wide-handsome”. He makes his famous hand-blow-kisses and is known for his daddy-jokes. He is great at and enjoys computer games, snowboarding, fishing and goes mostly with Suga since both have few friends they hang out with. Jin is quite shy and has mentioned he’s got no friends, besides his 7 dongsaengs = younger brothers of BTS who’re his family. Jin said: ”We’re together like 360 out of 365 days”. \nJust as J-Hope he is known for being a ”scaredy-cat”, gets scared easily. The members have been together almost 24/7 for 10 years and are like an ”old married couple”.\n\nV is born in Daegu and has a younger sister and younger brother. He lived with his grandmother for many years who passed away which he cryingly revealed on stage some years ago. He was 15 when he joined BigHit and also got to be the visual. He got known for his dorky side and goofy sense of humour. Fans has also said that he looked like a pretty anime characther. He is great in basketboll and learns new choreo quickly. He has a dog named Yeontan ”Tannie” who is well-known among Army and has appeared in tweets and BTS Bombs. In 2016 V starred in the Korean TV-drama ”Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth”. \n\nJ-Hope is born in Gwangju has an older sister Jiwoo. He is called ”the sunshine” of the group because of his sparky, energetic and enthusiastic nature, and has close to his loud, cheerful laughter. He can both rap and sing, and although RM and Suga are awesome in both ”classic” and ”melodic” rap, and can sing too, J-Hope is the best singer of the rapline. He was a dancer before BTS and is one of the group’s best dancers. He is their dance leader and in main charge of the choreography for BTS. They also got choreographer Son Sungdeuk who’ve been with them for a long time. J-Hope has a dog Mickey. \n \nJimin is born in Busan (just as JK) and has a younger brother Jihyun. The members have said that Jimin has a special aura about him, and is the cutest, most charming in the team: https://youtu.be/QHtRqopj3JI  He has a friendly, likable personality and is very funny: https://youtu.be/7nvkf6lRtZg \nHe is known for his androgynous attractive looks, and for being ”lovely, sexy and cute”. There’s a saying: ”Once u JimIN, u can’t JimOUT”. Some nicknames are ”Chimchim”, ”Minnie”, ”Mochi”, ”Mangetteok”(sticky ricecake), the last two he got in the beginning because he had his cute, milky, round, babyfat cheeks/face.\nIn school Jimin was excellent in both sports and academics, and was the ”Class President”. Above all, Jimin was legendary, an absolute top student at ”Busan Highschool of Arts” and was majoring in the modern/contemporary Dance department. He was (and still is) exceptional and entered at the top of his class, including all students of both genders and in all majors (Dance, Music, Arts). Normally students majoring in Music or Arts enter at the top, so it’s very rare for a Dance-majoring student to enter at the top. Jimin could’ve had a successful International career. At one of his teacher’s wedding, he got to do a solo dance performance. During middle school he attended a Dance Academy and learned popping and locking dance, and was winning street-dance battles in Busan. A young pre-debute Jimin: https://youtu.be/wPywFydPOS0  \nHis WIDE RANGE and brilliance in different genres (not only one), from hiphop to contemporary and classical ballet etc is astounding. He is one of the best dancers in the world, and definitely the best artist/idol dancer we’ve ever seen. Jimin is known for his perfect lines, impressive flexibility, prominent moves and extraordinary fluidity and smoothness. He is also known for his fascinating duality on and off stage.\n\nJimin has also studied different kinds of martial arts like Kendo, and had a black belt in Taekwondo. K-media wrote; ”Basketball, jump rope.. What can’t he do? Besides being an entertainment god with a natural sense of entertainment, he’s also outstanding athleticism”.\n\nJimin 21, is opening ”SBS Gayo Daejun 2016” with other pro-dancers and K-artists:\nhttps://youtu.be/bXN_TZyycYk\nhttps://youtu.be/vdOQsDO1gjA\nAs a dancer myself, I don’t think general people understand the strength and control Jimin has, and sadly never will. His flawless lines, his posture, how he keeps his toes pointed in his jumps, the airtime and still manage to lands lightly which takes years of hard training to ever attain. He is on a whole other level than any idol I’ve ever seen, even compared to these other dancers. He is very well-known among Korean modern dancers, who all agree he has raised the bar for idol dancers.\n\nJimin’s 24, breathtaking solo dance performance to a piano version of BTS’s song ”I need u”, at ”MMA” 2019: https://youtu.be/8D7Wnnow2kQ \n \nJ-Hope 24, Jimin 23, and Jungkook 21 (called the 3J’s and the best dancers), amazing performances to traditional Korean tunes and instruments, dressed in Korean attires at ”MMA” 2018: https://youtu.be/XozYg4IuDgY\nAfterwards Jimin recieved plaque of appreciation from the ”Cultural Conservation Society”. \n\nAt ”MAMA” 2016, Jimin 21 (impressively dancing blindfolded which is extremely difficult) and J-hope 22, performing perfectly in-sync: https://youtu.be/PYRiohUv-9Y\n\nJimin 24, Behind-the-scenes of his contemporary solo parts in Black Swan MV (2:40) : https://youtu.be/xMfp2jcK52M\n\nAt BTS’s online concert ”Map of the Soul ON:E” 2020, Jimin performed two solos. His incredible ”Black Swan” contemporary dance solo: \nPt.2 https://youtu.be/RM_OYxn0cTg\nPt.3 https://youtu.be/FL8sD9UHdZs\nPt.4 https://youtu.be/alm9jzWlmkI\nHis stunning performance of ”Filter”: https://youtu.be/FcVYa077Rgg\n\nNo band today, and no past Western boyband were ever close to any of this, nor be able to pull off World Stadium tours. Smaller concerts yesbut not close to arenas with 70000+ audience. Stadiums like MetLife, Rose Bowl, Soldier Field, Wembley, Stade de France etc. All members are individually very talented. They equally sing or rap with distinct voices which are easy to recognize, and together blend and harmonize perfectly. Unlike past Western boybands were litterally 2 or 3 out of 5 could sing. The rest were anonymous, had no solo parts and barely ever heard. BTS has set the bar high for future boybands. They’re pioneers, innovaters and was the first K-act and Asian-act to really make it in America and globally. Their hard work has undoubtly paved the way for other K-artists.\n\nThe premiere performance of ”Black Swan” from 2020 album ”Map Of The Soul: 7” at the ”Late late show with James Gordon”, proved once again they aren’t the prejudice of ”just a boyband”.

              ""textDisplay"": ""Part 3 of 7: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Sep 2018 they were the first Western and Korean boyband to be invited to the U.N. United Nations, for the launch ceremony of UNICEF&#39;s global partnership Generation Unlimited. BTS delivered a speech in which they urged young people to believe in their own convictions and voices, to not only Love Yourself but also to Speak Yourself. RM ended his speech with the words: ”No matter who you are, no matter where you’re from, your skin color, your gender identity..speak yourself, find your name and find your voice, by speaking yourself”. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the Korean music award season at the end of every year, BTS practices so hard for their performances. Award shows such as: Golden Disk Awards (GDA), Gaon Chart Music Awards, Seoul Music Awards (SMA), Korean Music Awards (KMA), Fact Music Awards, Asia Artist Awards (AAA), Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA), Melon Music Awards (MMA), Plus x Genie Music Awards (MGA), SBS Gayo Daejeon, KBS Gayo Daechukje. BTS has won the most ”Daesangs” (biggest prestigious main music awards) in S.Korean history as of now with over 40 daesangs. They’re also the overall most decorated K-artist in history. \u003cbr\u003eAt ”MAMA” 2019, BTS performed their first singles ”We Are Bulletproof Pt.2” and ”N.O” from 2013 debute album: \u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/gdrO-iU3Glg\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/gdrO-iU3Glg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA must-watch is the dance practice for their 2020 MAMA performance of ”ON”: \u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/81sNq45I48s\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/81sNq45I48s\u003c/a\u003e  Suga wasn’t able to perform that season due to a shoulder surgery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBTS was ignored at the Grammys 2020, despite the fact that they (with ”Map of the Soul: Persona”) had the 3rd bestselling album worldwide 2019, and litterally out-sold all the other artists that were nominated for ”Album of the year”. Some said BTS isn’t American and doesn’t sing in Englishbut it shouldn’t matter at all if looking back through the years with all non-Americans. Besides, it doesn’t need to be in English either. Puerto Rican Luis Fonci’s (born 1978) all Spanish ”Despacito” was totally embraced by the Grammys. \u003cbr\u003eFor the Grammys 2021, BTS finally got a nomination in the category ”Best Pop Duo/Group Performance”. Although they boys are ecstatic and honoured, alot of people agree they deserved nominations in other categories too. They had the bestselling album 2020, not only in S.Korea, Japan and USA but also Worldwide with masterpiece ”Map of The Soul: 7”, and really deserved a nomination in the ”Album of the year” category. Korean BTS has quality and artistery on all levels, which is something that alot of people in the American/European/Western music industry refuse to accept or admit. \u003cbr\u003eTheir spectacular ”Dynamite” performance: \u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/IU9KRreWIH8\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/IU9KRreWIH8\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, BTS is the first Korean-act in history to get a nomination, and also the first Korean act to perform at the Grammys in 2020, even though BTS was only ”back-up” for Lil Nas X.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“Please don’t forget that whether we get the Grammy or not, we already got what we wanted and we got YOU, so that means we got everything.” \u003cbr\u003e- Kim Namjoon (RM)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn their early years, BTS went through alot of sacrifices, hardships and struggles, both as a group and individually. Their tears and break-downs on stage (of gratitude, love, relief after hard work etc) during their speeches at award-shows and at concerts are heartbreaking. They’ve always loved, cared for, encouraged and inspired Army, and many have expressed how BTS and their music have lighten up and changed their lives. Army who’ve had a hard time have gained positivity, strength, confidence, well-being, inspiration and belief for the future etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt’s unfair and sad that alot of Western showbiz and media plainly ignore and reduce BTS, and that many radio channels won’t play their music. Those people don’t know anything about BTS and aren’t interested in finding out either. But still they’re discriminating, downgrading, not taking them seriously and don’t give them recognition only because they’re a Korean/East Asian group. They should step back with their narrow minds and predjudice. How can their race matter that much?\u003cbr\u003eRM said: ”We’re just normal guys who love to make music and to perform, and want to share it with our fans”. \u003cbr\u003eBesides, BTS isn’t just ”any” Kpop group. They’re totally outstanding and has an unique charm we haven’t seen before. Their music and achievements are groundbreaking, not only in Kpop but in the global scene. Their consistency, passion, dedication, hard work, artistery and talent are undeniable. What makes other Western artists’ generic mainstream music more real and genuine whose music are being played over and over?! Besides, Western media is unreasonably never ranking BTS in the top of ”the biggest boybands in history-lists”. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKpop has a huge domestic market and has for a long time been considered a generic name for all Korean music genres, not only pop. No one needs to hit globally to become stars. BTS has never needed to collab. with a Western artist or make an English album to become superstars, or get where they are today. They’ve made it on their own singing in Korean. They’ve collab. simply because they’ve liked the artist. The truth is, other artists would gain more of a collab. with BTS than the other way around because of BTS’s huge fanbase. Yet in interviews they’re repeatedly asked which Western artist they want to collab. with, as if it’d be the highest wish of their career. They’re also pressured when always asked about their next goal, instead of letting them breath after hard work and enjoy the moment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBTS is mainly producing, composing and writing their own songs and lyrics, sometimes co-writing too. They’re dedicated and sincere with alot of thoughts and reflections behind their music. It’s not just empty words written by others who don’t know them. The members’ solo songs are written by the member himself or together with a member. They’ve also released non-profitable solo songs (and not on an official album), like Jimin’s ”Promise” and V’s ”Winter Bear” on SoundCloud. JK has multiple times released incredible English and Korean ballad covers. Some releases have also been surprises for Army at the ”BTS Festa” through the years. JK and Jimin made a beautiful cover of ”We Don’t Talk Anymore” for the 2017 ”BTS Festa”.\u003cbr\u003eBTS’s work is inspired by litterature, art and philosophy. Their lyricism is well-written, poetical and really on another level. All their MV’s have English subs that International Army are suppose to turn on, although the English translations can’t do fully justice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBTS has a solid discography in both Korean and Japanese with roots in hiphop and R&amp;B. In their early years all 7 studied Japanese and all members can speak Japanese, especially JK and the maknae line as they were younger when they started. When they perform in Japan they sing many of their songs in Japanese. There’re also songs made only in Japanese, like awesome ”Don’t Leave Me”: \u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/Cz6BUM4F2tY\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/Cz6BUM4F2tY\u003c/a\u003e and ”Stay Gold”: \u003ca href=\""https://youtu.be/9C1BNeLmhLk\""\u003ehttps://youtu.be/9C1BNeLmhLk\u003c/a\u003e  All BTS’s albums are highly complex concept albums, always with a well thought-out theme and storyline. The songs and MV’s for the songs on the same album, have intertwined connections, messages and symbolism. They also connect with their previous work, and if u put all the albums together in order they tell a ”story”. Usually Army discover the connections little by little, sometimes making theories too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRM 26 is born in Ilsan and has a younger sister. He was in the underground scene for a long time before BTS, and has over 150 songs under his name, all masterpieces. He is a prodigy but underrated. He has an IQ of over 148 and scored among the highest within the top 1% of the nation in the massive University Entrance Exams. He also scored over 900 on the ”Test of English for International Communication” while he was still in Middle school. He is awesome in English which he learned as a youngster by watching TV-show ”Friends”. He’s known for his ”cultural” side and is collecting arts, enjoys museums, parks, sightseeing, bicycling. He’s also known for being clumsy, accidentally spilling, breaking or hitting things as well as losing his stuff (passport, earpods, mobile), and is by the members called ”God of destruction”. He’s been quite bad at cooking, although he and the others have improved through the years. Suga and Jin are the best chefs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuga is born in Daegu and has an older brother. He got early known as the ”savage” of the group. He is deep, wise, honest, doesn’t open-up or show feelings easily and isn’t as touchy-feely. He usually dosen’t show as much facial expressions or make eye contact, which are something that the other members have had alot of fun about. He’s is known for his gummy smile.

              ""textOriginal"": ""Part 3 of 7: \n\nIn Sep 2018 they were the first Western and Korean boyband to be invited to the U.N. United Nations, for the launch ceremony of UNICEF's global partnership Generation Unlimited. BTS delivered a speech in which they urged young people to believe in their own convictions and voices, to not only Love Yourself but also to Speak Yourself. RM ended his speech with the words: ”No matter who you are, no matter where you’re from, your skin color, your gender identity..speak yourself, find your name and find your voice, by speaking yourself”. \n\nFor the Korean music award season at the end of every year, BTS practices so hard for their performances. Award shows such as: Golden Disk Awards (GDA), Gaon Chart Music Awards, Seoul Music Awards (SMA), Korean Music Awards (KMA), Fact Music Awards, Asia Artist Awards (AAA), Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA), Melon Music Awards (MMA), Plus x Genie Music Awards (MGA), SBS Gayo Daejeon, KBS Gayo Daechukje. BTS has won the most ”Daesangs” (biggest prestigious main music awards) in S.Korean history as of now with over 40 daesangs. They’re also the overall most decorated K-artist in history. \nAt ”MAMA” 2019, BTS performed their first singles ”We Are Bulletproof Pt.2” and ”N.O” from 2013 debute album: https://youtu.be/gdrO-iU3Glg\nA must-watch is the dance practice for their 2020 MAMA performance of ”ON”: https://youtu.be/81sNq45I48s  Suga wasn’t able to perform that season due to a shoulder surgery.\n\nBTS was ignored at the Grammys 2020, despite the fact that they (with ”Map of the Soul: Persona”) had the 3rd bestselling album worldwide 2019, and litterally out-sold all the other artists that were nominated for ”Album of the year”. Some said BTS isn’t American and doesn’t sing in Englishbut it shouldn’t matter at all if looking back through the years with all non-Americans. Besides, it doesn’t need to be in English either. Puerto Rican Luis Fonci’s (born 1978) all Spanish ”Despacito” was totally embraced by the Grammys. \nFor the Grammys 2021, BTS finally got a nomination in the category ”Best Pop Duo/Group Performance”. Although they boys are ecstatic and honoured, alot of people agree they deserved nominations in other categories too. They had the bestselling album 2020, not only in S.Korea, Japan and USA but also Worldwide with masterpiece ”Map of The Soul: 7”, and really deserved a nomination in the ”Album of the year” category. Korean BTS has quality and artistery on all levels, which is something that alot of people in the American/European/Western music industry refuse to accept or admit. \nTheir spectacular ”Dynamite” performance: https://youtu.be/IU9KRreWIH8\nHowever, BTS is the first Korean-act in history to get a nomination, and also the first Korean act to perform at the Grammys in 2020, even though BTS was only ”back-up” for Lil Nas X.\n\n“Please don’t forget that whether we get the Grammy or not, we already got what we wanted and we got YOU, so that means we got everything.” \n- Kim Namjoon (RM)\n\nIn their early years, BTS went through alot of sacrifices, hardships and struggles, both as a group and individually. Their tears and break-downs on stage (of gratitude, love, relief after hard work etc) during their speeches at award-shows and at concerts are heartbreaking. They’ve always loved, cared for, encouraged and inspired Army, and many have expressed how BTS and their music have lighten up and changed their lives. Army who’ve had a hard time have gained positivity, strength, confidence, well-being, inspiration and belief for the future etc.\n\nIt’s unfair and sad that alot of Western showbiz and media plainly ignore and reduce BTS, and that many radio channels won’t play their music. Those people don’t know anything about BTS and aren’t interested in finding out either. But still they’re discriminating, downgrading, not taking them seriously and don’t give them recognition only because they’re a Korean/East Asian group. They should step back with their narrow minds and predjudice. How can their race matter that much?\nRM said: ”We’re just normal guys who love to make music and to perform, and want to share it with our fans”. \nBesides, BTS isn’t just ”any” Kpop group. They’re totally outstanding and has an unique charm we haven’t seen before. Their music and achievements are groundbreaking, not only in Kpop but in the global scene. Their consistency, passion, dedication, hard work, artistery and talent are undeniable. What makes other Western artists’ generic mainstream music more real and genuine whose music are being played over and over?! Besides, Western media is unreasonably never ranking BTS in the top of ”the biggest boybands in history-lists”. \n\nKpop has a huge domestic market and has for a long time been considered a generic name for all Korean music genres, not only pop. No one needs to hit globally to become stars. BTS has never needed to collab. with a Western artist or make an English album to become superstars, or get where they are today. They’ve made it on their own singing in Korean. They’ve collab. simply because they’ve liked the artist. The truth is, other artists would gain more of a collab. with BTS than the other way around because of BTS’s huge fanbase. Yet in interviews they’re repeatedly asked which Western artist they want to collab. with, as if it’d be the highest wish of their career. They’re also pressured when always asked about their next goal, instead of letting them breath after hard work and enjoy the moment. \n\nBTS is mainly producing, composing and writing their own songs and lyrics, sometimes co-writing too. They’re dedicated and sincere with alot of thoughts and reflections behind their music. It’s not just empty words written by others who don’t know them. The members’ solo songs are written by the member himself or together with a member. They’ve also released non-profitable solo songs (and not on an official album), like Jimin’s ”Promise” and V’s ”Winter Bear” on SoundCloud. JK has multiple times released incredible English and Korean ballad covers. Some releases have also been surprises for Army at the ”BTS Festa” through the years. JK and Jimin made a beautiful cover of ”We Don’t Talk Anymore” for the 2017 ”BTS Festa”.\nBTS’s work is inspired by litterature, art and philosophy. Their lyricism is well-written, poetical and really on another level. All their MV’s have English subs that International Army are suppose to turn on, although the English translations can’t do fully justice.\n\nBTS has a solid discography in both Korean and Japanese with roots in hiphop and R&B. In their early years all 7 studied Japanese and all members can speak Japanese, especially JK and the maknae line as they were younger when they started. When they perform in Japan they sing many of their songs in Japanese. There’re also songs made only in Japanese, like awesome ”Don’t Leave Me”: https://youtu.be/Cz6BUM4F2tY and ”Stay Gold”: https://youtu.be/9C1BNeLmhLk  All BTS’s albums are highly complex concept albums, always with a well thought-out theme and storyline. The songs and MV’s for the songs on the same album, have intertwined connections, messages and symbolism. They also connect with their previous work, and if u put all the albums together in order they tell a ”story”. Usually Army discover the connections little by little, sometimes making theories too.\n\nRM 26 is born in Ilsan and has a younger sister. He was in the underground scene for a long time before BTS, and has over 150 songs under his name, all masterpieces. He is a prodigy but underrated. He has an IQ of over 148 and scored among the highest within the top 1% of the nation in the massive University Entrance Exams. He also scored over 900 on the ”Test of English for International Communication” while he was still in Middle school. He is awesome in English which he learned as a youngster by watching TV-show ”Friends”. He’s known for his ”cultural” side and is collecting arts, enjoys museums, parks, sightseeing, bicycling. He’s also known for being clumsy, accidentally spilling, breaking or hitting things as well as losing his stuff (passport, earpods, mobile), and is by the members called ”God of destruction”. He’s been quite bad at cooking, although he and the others have improved through the years. Suga and Jin are the best chefs.\n\nSuga is born in Daegu and has an older brother. He got early known as the ”savage” of the group. He is deep, wise, honest, doesn’t open-up or show feelings easily and isn’t as touchy-feely. He usually dosen’t show as much facial expressions or make eye contact, which are something that the other members have had alot of fun about. He’s is known for his gummy smile. The members and Army sometimes make jokes about him for being tired, wanting to rest or sleep, not moving if not necessary.
