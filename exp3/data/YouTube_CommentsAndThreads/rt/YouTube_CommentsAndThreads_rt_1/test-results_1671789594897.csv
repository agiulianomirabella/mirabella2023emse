If you travel at the speed of light for 15 minutes away from Earth, it does not mean 10 years have passed on earth. The fact that 10 years in normal speed would equal 15 minutes of light-speed does not mean the Earth will go slower or faster. Both for you and Earth, 15 minutes have passed after you travelled away for 15 minutes at lightspeed. If you look back at Earth you will see how it was 15 minutes ago. So, exactly how you left it. Like time did not pass. If you go back to Earth for another 15 minutes with again speed of light... you have been gone for 30 minutes in total for yourself. And as you are travelling back you will see everything from how it was 15 minutes ago going twice as fast forward..  meaning you will see 30 minutes of time playing out in 15 minutes from your view. Which is the original 15 minutes that you missed (and saw standing still while on Earth everythinh was still going) plus the new 15 minutes.\n\nSame problem I have with Einsteins example. As you are moving away from the clock at the speed of light... you see things how they were.
