            ""textDisplay"": ""Miusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,&quot; began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. &quot;Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima&#39;s cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as&quot; -- he glanced at the monks -- &quot;your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I&#39;ve been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder&#39;s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;How disgraveful!&quot; cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said the Father Superior. &quot;It was said of old, &#39;Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#39; And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!&quot; and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Drive on!&quot; Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, you are a fellow,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, &quot;Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You&#39;ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&quot; Ivan snaped sullenly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&quot; he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan was still silent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\u003cbr\u003eMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,&quot; began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. &quot;Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima&#39;s cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as&quot; -- he glanced at the monks -- &quot;your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I&#39;ve been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder&#39;s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;How disgraveful!&quot; cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said the Father Superior. &quot;It was said of old, &#39;Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#39; And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!&quot; and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Drive on!&quot; Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, you are a fellow,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, &quot;Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You&#39;ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&quot; Ivan snaped sullenly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&quot; he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan was still silent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\u003cbr\u003eMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,&quot; began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. &quot;Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima&#39;s cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as&quot; -- he glanced at the monks -- &quot;your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I&#39;ve been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder&#39;s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;How disgraveful!&quot; cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said the Father Superior. &quot;It was said of old, &#39;Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#39; And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!&quot; and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Drive on!&quot; Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, you are a fellow,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, &quot;Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You&#39;ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&quot; Ivan snaped sullenly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&quot; he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan was still silent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\u003cbr\u003eMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,&quot; began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. &quot;Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima&#39;s cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as&quot; -- he glanced at the monks -- &quot;your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I&#39;ve been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder&#39;s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;How disgraveful!&quot; cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said the Father Superior. &quot;It was said of old, &#39;Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#39; And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!&quot; and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Drive on!&quot; Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, you are a fellow,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, &quot;Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You&#39;ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&quot; Ivan snaped sullenly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&quot; he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan was still silent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\u003cbr\u003eMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s.

It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I&#39;ve been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder&#39;s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;How disgraveful!&quot; cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said the Father Superior. &quot;It was said of old, &#39;Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#39; And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!&quot; and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Drive on!&quot; Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, you are a fellow,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, &quot;Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You&#39;ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&quot; Ivan snaped sullenly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&quot; he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan was still silent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\u003cbr\u003eMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,&quot; began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. &quot;Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima&#39;s cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as&quot; -- he glanced at the monks -- &quot;your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I&#39;ve been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder&#39;s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;How disgraveful!&quot; cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said the Father Superior. &quot;It was said of old, &#39;Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#39; And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!&quot; and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Drive on!&quot; Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, you are a fellow,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, &quot;Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You&#39;ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&quot; Ivan snaped sullenly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&quot; he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan was still silent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\u003cbr\u003eMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,&quot; began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. &quot;Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima&#39;s cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as&quot; -- he glanced at the monks -- &quot;your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care.

As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud?

There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere.

Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent.

It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers!

Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut!

Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn.

            ""textOriginal"": ""Miusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. \""Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,\"" he reflceted, on the steps. \""And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.\""\n\nHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\n\nThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior's diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\n\nRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\n\n\""We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,\"" began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. \""Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as\"" -- he glanced at the monks -- \""your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.\""\n\nAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\n\n\""I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.\""\n\nHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\n\nIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder's: \""I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.\"" He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, \""Why do you hate so and so, so much?\"" And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, \""I'll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.\""\n\nRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\n\n\""Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,\"" he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, \""Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don't care what they think -- that's all!\""\n\nHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior's. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior's dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. \""They thought I had gone, and here I am again,\"" he cried to the wholle room.\n\nFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\n\n\""No! this I cannot endure!\"" he cried. \""I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!\""\n\nThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n\""What is it he cannot?\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \""that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?\""\n\n\""You are welcome with all my heart,\"" answerred the Superior. \""Gentlemen!\"" he added, \""I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.\""\n\n\""No, no, it is impossible!\"" cryed Miusov, beside himself.\n\n\""Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""Do you mean me?\"" mutered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n\""Of course I mean you,\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \""Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.\""\n\n\""But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.\""\n\n\""No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""What is happening? What's this?\"" voices were heard in the groop of monks.\n\n\""Let us go,\"" cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\n\n\""No, excuse me,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. \""Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.\""\n\nWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\n\n\""How disgraveful!\"" cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\n\n\""Pardon me!\"" said the Father Superior. \""It was said of old, 'Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.' And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!\"" and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\n\n\""Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's Robbers. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you'll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?\"" He went up to the table. \""Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.\""\n\n\""This is too disgraceful!\"" said Father Iosif.\n\nFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\n\n\""Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.\"" He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. \""This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers!

And so will we.\""\n\n\""Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go.

I've cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.\"" He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\n\nIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\n\n\""Alexey!\"" his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. \""You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.\""\n\nAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense.

Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\n\nRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\n\n\""We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,\"" began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. \""Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as\"" -- he glanced at the monks -- \""your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.\""\n\nAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\n\n\""I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.\""\n\nHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\n\nIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder's: \""I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.\"" He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, \""Why do you hate so and so, so much?\"" And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, \""I'll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.\""\n\nRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\n\n\""Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,\"" he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, \""Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don't care what they think -- that's all!\""\n\nHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior's. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior's dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. \""They thought I had gone, and here I am again,\"" he cried to the wholle room.\n\nFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\n\n\""No! this I cannot endure!\"" he cried. \""I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!\""\n\nThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n\""What is it he cannot?\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \""that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?\""\n\n\""You are welcome with all my heart,\"" answerred the Superior. \""Gentlemen!\"" he added, \""I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.\""\n\n\""No, no, it is impossible!\"" cryed Miusov, beside himself.\n\n\""Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""Do you mean me?\"" mutered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n\""Of course I mean you,\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \""Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.\""\n\n\""But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.\""\n\n\""No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""What is happening? What's this?\"" voices were heard in the groop of monks.\n\n\""Let us go,\"" cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\n\n\""No, excuse me,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. \""Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.\""\n\nWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\n\n\""How disgraveful!\"" cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\n\n\""Pardon me!\"" said the Father Superior. \""It was said of old, 'Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.' And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!\"" and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\n\n\""Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's Robbers. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you'll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?\"" He went up to the table. \""Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.\""\n\n\""This is too disgraceful!\"" said Father Iosif.\n\nFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\n\n\""Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.\"" He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. \""This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!\""\n\nIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\n\nThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\n\n\""It is writen again, 'Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.' And so will we.\""\n\n\""Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I've cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.\"" He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\n\nIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\n\n\""Alexey!\"" his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. \""You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.\""\n\nAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. \""I am going with you! \"" he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. \""Take me, too.\""\n\n\""There!\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. \""Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!\""\n\nBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\n\n\""Drive on!\"" Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\n\n\""Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\n\nBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\n\n\""Well, you are a fellow,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\n\nAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, \""Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?\""\n\n\""You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,\"" Ivan snaped sullenly.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\n\n\""A drop of brandy would be nice now,\"" he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\n\n\""You shall have some, too, when we get home.\""\n\nIvan was still silent.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\n\n\""But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.\""\n\nIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\nMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. \""Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,\"" he reflceted, on the steps. \""And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.\""\n\nHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\n\nThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior's diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\n\nRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also.

The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's Robbers. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you'll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?\"" He went up to the table. \""Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.\""\n\n\""This is too disgraceful!\"" said Father Iosif.\n\nFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\n\n\""Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.\"" He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. \""This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!\""\n\nIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\n\nThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\n\n\""It is writen again, 'Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.' And so will we.\""\n\n\""Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I've cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.\"" He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\n\nIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\n\n\""Alexey!\"" his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. \""You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.\""\n\nAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. \""I am going with you! \"" he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. \""Take me, too.\""\n\n\""There!\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. \""Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!\""\n\nBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\n\n\""Drive on!\"" Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\n\n\""Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\n\nBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\n\n\""Well, you are a fellow,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\n\nAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, \""Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?\""\n\n\""You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,\"" Ivan snaped sullenly.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\n\n\""A drop of brandy would be nice now,\"" he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\n\n\""You shall have some, too, when we get home.\""\n\nIvan was still silent.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\n\n\""But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.\""\n\nIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\nMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. \""Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,\"" he reflceted, on the steps. \""And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.\""\n\nHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\n\nThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior's diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\n\nRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\n\n\""We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,\"" began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. \""Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as\"" -- he glanced at the monks -- \""your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.\""\n\nAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\n\n\""I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.\""\n\nHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\n\nIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder's: \""I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.\"" He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, \""Why do you hate so and so, so much?\"" And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, \""I'll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.\""\n\nRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\n\n\""Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,\"" he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, \""Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don't care what they think -- that's all!\""\n\nHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior's. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior's dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. \""They thought I had gone, and here I am again,\"" he cried to the wholle room.\n\nFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\n\n\""No! this I cannot endure!\"" he cried. \""I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!\""\n\nThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n\""What is it he cannot?\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \""that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?\""\n\n\""You are welcome with all my heart,\"" answerred the Superior. \""Gentlemen!\"" he added, \""I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.\""\n\n\""No, no, it is impossible!\"" cryed Miusov, beside himself.\n\n\""Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""Do you mean me?\"" mutered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n\""Of course I mean you,\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \""Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.\""\n\n\""But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.\""\n\n\""No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""What is happening? What's this?\"" voices were heard in the groop of monks.\n\n\""Let us go,\"" cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\n\n\""No, excuse me,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. \""Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.\""\n\nWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\n\n\""How disgraveful!\"" cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\n\n\""Pardon me!\"" said the Father Superior. \""It was said of old, 'Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.' And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!\"" and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\n\n\""Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's Robbers. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth.

He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.\""\n\nAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\n\n\""I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.\""\n\nHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\n\nIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder's: \""I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.\"" He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, \""Why do you hate so and so, so much?\"" And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, \""I'll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.\""\n\nRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\n\n\""Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,\"" he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, \""Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don't care what they think -- that's all!\""\n\nHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior's. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior's dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. \""They thought I had gone, and here I am again,\"" he cried to the wholle room.\n\nFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\n\n\""No! this I cannot endure!\"" he cried. \""I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!\""\n\nThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n\""What is it he cannot?\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \""that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?\""\n\n\""You are welcome with all my heart,\"" answerred the Superior. \""Gentlemen!\"" he added, \""I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.\""\n\n\""No, no, it is impossible!\"" cryed Miusov, beside himself.\n\n\""Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""Do you mean me?\"" mutered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n\""Of course I mean you,\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \""Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.\""\n\n\""But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.\""\n\n\""No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""What is happening? What's this?\"" voices were heard in the groop of monks.\n\n\""Let us go,\"" cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\n\n\""No, excuse me,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. \""Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.\""\n\nWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\n\n\""How disgraveful!\"" cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\n\n\""Pardon me!\"" said the Father Superior. \""It was said of old, 'Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.' And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!\"" and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\n\n\""Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's Robbers. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you'll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?\"" He went up to the table. \""Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.\""\n\n\""This is too disgraceful!\"" said Father Iosif.\n\nFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\n\n\""Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.\"" He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. \""This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!\""\n\nIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\n\nThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\n\n\""It is writen again, 'Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.' And so will we.\""\n\n\""Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I've cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.\"" He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\n\nIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\n\n\""Alexey!\"" his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. \""You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.\""\n\nAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. \""I am going with you! \"" he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. \""Take me, too.\""\n\n\""There!\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. \""Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!\""\n\nBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\n\n\""Drive on!\"" Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\n\n\""Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\n\nBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\n\n\""Well, you are a fellow,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\n\nAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, \""Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?\""\n\n\""You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,\"" Ivan snaped sullenly.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\n\n\""A drop of brandy would be nice now,\"" he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\n\n\""You shall have some, too, when we get home.\""\n\nIvan was still silent.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\n\n\""But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.\""\n\nIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\nMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. \""Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,\"" he reflceted, on the steps. \""And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.\""\n\nHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\n\nThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior's diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\n\nRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\n\n\""We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,\"" began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. \""Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as\"" -- he glanced at the monks -- \""your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.\""\n\nAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\n\n\""I sincerly deplore his absence.

This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!\""\n\nIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\n\nThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\n\n\""It is writen again, 'Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.' And so will we.\""\n\n\""Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I've cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.\"" He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\n\nIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\n\n\""Alexey!\"" his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. \""You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.\""\n\nAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. \""I am going with you! \"" he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. \""Take me, too.\""\n\n\""There!\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. \""Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!\""\n\nBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\n\n\""Drive on!\"" Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\n\n\""Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\n\nBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\n\n\""Well, you are a fellow,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\n\nAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, \""Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?\""\n\n\""You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,\"" Ivan snaped sullenly.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\n\n\""A drop of brandy would be nice now,\"" he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\n\n\""You shall have some, too, when we get home.\""\n\nIvan was still silent.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\n\n\""But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.\""\n\nIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\nMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. \""Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,\"" he reflceted, on the steps. \""And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.\""\n\nHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\n\nThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior's diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\n\nRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\n\n\""We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,\"" began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. \""Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as\"" -- he glanced at the monks -- \""your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.\""\n\nAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\n\n\""I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.\""\n\nHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\n\nIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder's: \""I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.\"" He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, \""Why do you hate so and so, so much?\"" And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, \""I'll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.\""\n\nRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\n\n\""Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,\"" he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, \""Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don't care what they think -- that's all!\""\n\nHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior's. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior's dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. \""They thought I had gone, and here I am again,\"" he cried to the wholle room.\n\nFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\n\n\""No! this I cannot endure!\"" he cried. \""I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!\""\n\nThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n\""What is it he cannot?\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \""that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?\""\n\n\""You are welcome with all my heart,\"" answerred the Superior. \""Gentlemen!\"" he added, \""I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.\""\n\n\""No, no, it is impossible!\"" cryed Miusov, beside himself.\n\n\""Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""Do you mean me?\"" mutered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n\""Of course I mean you,\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \""Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.\""\n\n\""But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.\""\n\n\""No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""What is happening? What's this?\"" voices were heard in the groop of monks.\n\n\""Let us go,\"" cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\n\n\""No, excuse me,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. \""Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.\""\n\nWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\n\n\""How disgraveful!\"" cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\n\n\""Pardon me!\"" said the Father Superior. \""It was said of old, 'Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.' And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!\"" and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\n\n\""Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's Robbers. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you'll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?\"" He went up to the table. \""Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.\""\n\n\""This is too disgraceful!\"" said Father Iosif.\n\nFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\n\n\""Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.\"" He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. \""This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways.

            ""textDisplay"": ""Miusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,&quot; began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. &quot;Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima&#39;s cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as&quot; -- he glanced at the monks -- &quot;your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I&#39;ve been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder&#39;s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;How disgraveful!&quot; cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said the Father Superior. &quot;It was said of old, &#39;Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#39; And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!&quot; and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Drive on!&quot; Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, you are a fellow,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, &quot;Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You&#39;ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&quot; Ivan snaped sullenly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&quot; he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan was still silent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\u003cbr\u003eMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,&quot; began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. &quot;Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima&#39;s cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as&quot; -- he glanced at the monks -- &quot;your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I&#39;ve been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder&#39;s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;How disgraveful!&quot; cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said the Father Superior. &quot;It was said of old, &#39;Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#39; And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!&quot; and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Drive on!&quot; Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, you are a fellow,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, &quot;Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You&#39;ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&quot; Ivan snaped sullenly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&quot; he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan was still silent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\u003cbr\u003eMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,&quot; began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. &quot;Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima&#39;s cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as&quot; -- he glanced at the monks -- &quot;your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I&#39;ve been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder&#39;s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;How disgraveful!&quot; cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said the Father Superior. &quot;It was said of old, &#39;Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#39; And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!&quot; and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Drive on!&quot; Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, you are a fellow,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, &quot;Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You&#39;ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&quot; Ivan snaped sullenly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&quot; he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan was still silent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\u003cbr\u003eMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem?

All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I&#39;ve been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder&#39;s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;How disgraveful!&quot; cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said the Father Superior. &quot;It was said of old, &#39;Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#39; And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!&quot; and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Drive on!&quot; Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, you are a fellow,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, &quot;Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You&#39;ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&quot; Ivan snaped sullenly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&quot; he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan was still silent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\u003cbr\u003eMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,&quot; began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. &quot;Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima&#39;s cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as&quot; -- he glanced at the monks -- &quot;your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I&#39;ve been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder&#39;s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;How disgraveful!&quot; cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said the Father Superior. &quot;It was said of old, &#39;Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#39; And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!&quot; and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Drive on!&quot; Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, you are a fellow,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, &quot;Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You&#39;ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&quot; Ivan snaped sullenly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&quot; he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan was still silent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\u003cbr\u003eMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,&quot; began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. &quot;Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima&#39;s cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as&quot; -- he glanced at the monks -- &quot;your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.

There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere.

Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Drive on!&quot; Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, you are a fellow,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, &quot;Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You&#39;ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&quot; Ivan snaped sullenly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&quot; he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan was still silent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\u003cbr\u003eMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior&#39;s with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,&quot; began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. &quot;Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima&#39;s cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as&quot; -- he glanced at the monks -- &quot;your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I&#39;ve been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder&#39;s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;How disgraveful!&quot; cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said the Father Superior. &quot;It was said of old, &#39;Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#39; And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!&quot; and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn.

            ""textOriginal"": ""Miusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. \""Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,\"" he reflceted, on the steps. \""And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.\""\n\nHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\n\nThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior's diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\n\nRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\n\n\""We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,\"" began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. \""Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as\"" -- he glanced at the monks -- \""your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.\""\n\nAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\n\n\""I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.\""\n\nHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\n\nIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder's: \""I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.\"" He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, \""Why do you hate so and so, so much?\"" And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, \""I'll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.\""\n\nRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\n\n\""Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,\"" he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, \""Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don't care what they think -- that's all!\""\n\nHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior's. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior's dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. \""They thought I had gone, and here I am again,\"" he cried to the wholle room.\n\nFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\n\n\""No! this I cannot endure!\"" he cried. \""I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!\""\n\nThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n\""What is it he cannot?\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \""that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?\""\n\n\""You are welcome with all my heart,\"" answerred the Superior. \""Gentlemen!\"" he added, \""I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.\""\n\n\""No, no, it is impossible!\"" cryed Miusov, beside himself.\n\n\""Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""Do you mean me?\"" mutered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n\""Of course I mean you,\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \""Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.\""\n\n\""But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.\""\n\n\""No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""What is happening? What's this?\"" voices were heard in the groop of monks.\n\n\""Let us go,\"" cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\n\n\""No, excuse me,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. \""Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.\""\n\nWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\n\n\""How disgraveful!\"" cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\n\n\""Pardon me!\"" said the Father Superior. \""It was said of old, 'Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.' And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!\"" and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\n\n\""Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's Robbers. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you'll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?\"" He went up to the table. \""Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.\""\n\n\""This is too disgraceful!\"" said Father Iosif.\n\nFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\n\n\""Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.\"" He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. \""This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!\""\n\nIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\n\nThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\n\n\""It is writen again, 'Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.' And so will we.\""\n\n\""Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I've cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.\"" He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\n\nIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\n\n\""Alexey!\"" his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. \""You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.\""\n\nAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. \""I am going with you! \"" he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. \""Take me, too.\""\n\n\""There!\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. \""Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!\""\n\nBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\n\n\""Drive on!\"" Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\n\n\""Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\n\nBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\n\n\""Well, you are a fellow,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\n\nAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, \""Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines.

Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. \""They thought I had gone, and here I am again,\"" he cried to the wholle room.\n\nFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\n\n\""No! this I cannot endure!\"" he cried. \""I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!\""\n\nThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n\""What is it he cannot?\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \""that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?\""\n\n\""You are welcome with all my heart,\"" answerred the Superior. \""Gentlemen!\"" he added, \""I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.\""\n\n\""No, no, it is impossible!\"" cryed Miusov, beside himself.\n\n\""Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""Do you mean me?\"" mutered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n\""Of course I mean you,\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \""Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.\""\n\n\""But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.\""\n\n\""No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""What is happening? What's this?\"" voices were heard in the groop of monks.\n\n\""Let us go,\"" cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\n\n\""No, excuse me,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. \""Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.\""\n\nWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\n\n\""How disgraveful!\"" cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\n\n\""Pardon me!\"" said the Father Superior. \""It was said of old, 'Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.' And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!\"" and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\n\n\""Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's Robbers. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you'll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?\"" He went up to the table. \""Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.\""\n\n\""This is too disgraceful!\"" said Father Iosif.\n\nFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\n\n\""Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.\"" He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. \""This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!\""\n\nIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\n\nThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\n\n\""It is writen again, 'Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.' And so will we.\""\n\n\""Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I've cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.\"" He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\n\nIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\n\n\""Alexey!\"" his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. \""You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.\""\n\nAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. \""I am going with you! \"" he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. \""Take me, too.\""\n\n\""There!\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. \""Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!\""\n\nBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\n\n\""Drive on!\"" Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\n\n\""Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\n\nBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\n\n\""Well, you are a fellow,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\n\nAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, \""Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?\""\n\n\""You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,\"" Ivan snaped sullenly.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\n\n\""A drop of brandy would be nice now,\"" he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\n\n\""You shall have some, too, when we get home.\""\n\nIvan was still silent.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\n\n\""But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.\""\n\nIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\nMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. \""Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,\"" he reflceted, on the steps. \""And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.\""\n\nHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\n\nThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior's diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\n\nRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\n\n\""We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,\"" began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. \""Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as\"" -- he glanced at the monks -- \""your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.\""\n\nAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\n\n\""I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.\""\n\nHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\n\nIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder's: \""I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.\"" He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, \""Why do you hate so and so, so much?\"" And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, \""I'll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.\""\n\nRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\n\n\""Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,\"" he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, \""Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don't care what they think -- that's all!\""\n\nHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior's. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior's dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. \""They thought I had gone, and here I am again,\"" he cried to the wholle room.\n\nFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\n\n\""No! this I cannot endure!\"" he cried. \""I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!\""\n\nThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n\""What is it he cannot?\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \""that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot?

I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!\""\n\nBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\n\n\""Drive on!\"" Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\n\n\""Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\n\nBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\n\n\""Well, you are a fellow,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\n\nAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, \""Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?\""\n\n\""You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,\"" Ivan snaped sullenly.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\n\n\""A drop of brandy would be nice now,\"" he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\n\n\""You shall have some, too, when we get home.\""\n\nIvan was still silent.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\n\n\""But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.\""\n\nIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\nMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. \""Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,\"" he reflceted, on the steps. \""And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.\""\n\nHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\n\nThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior's diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\n\nRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\n\n\""We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,\"" began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. \""Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as\"" -- he glanced at the monks -- \""your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.\""\n\nAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\n\n\""I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.\""\n\nHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\n\nIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder's: \""I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.\"" He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, \""Why do you hate so and so, so much?\"" And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, \""I'll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.\""\n\nRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\n\n\""Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,\"" he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, \""Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don't care what they think -- that's all!\""\n\nHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior's. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior's dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. \""They thought I had gone, and here I am again,\"" he cried to the wholle room.\n\nFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\n\n\""No! this I cannot endure!\"" he cried. \""I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!\""\n\nThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n\""What is it he cannot?\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \""that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?\""\n\n\""You are welcome with all my heart,\"" answerred the Superior. \""Gentlemen!\"" he added, \""I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.\""\n\n\""No, no, it is impossible!\"" cryed Miusov, beside himself.\n\n\""Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""Do you mean me?\"" mutered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n\""Of course I mean you,\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \""Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.\""\n\n\""But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.\""\n\n\""No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""What is happening? What's this?\"" voices were heard in the groop of monks.\n\n\""Let us go,\"" cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\n\n\""No, excuse me,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. \""Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.\""\n\nWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\n\n\""How disgraveful!\"" cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\n\n\""Pardon me!\"" said the Father Superior. \""It was said of old, 'Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.' And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!\"" and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\n\n\""Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's Robbers. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you'll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?\"" He went up to the table. \""Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.\""\n\n\""This is too disgraceful!\"" said Father Iosif.\n\nFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\n\n\""Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.\"" He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. \""This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!\""\n\nIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\n\nThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\n\n\""It is writen again, 'Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.' And so will we.\""\n\n\""Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I've cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.\"" He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\n\nIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\n\n\""Alexey!\"" his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. \""You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.\""\n\nAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. \""I am going with you! \"" he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. \""Take me, too.\""\n\n\""There!\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. \""Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!\""\n\nBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\n\n\""Drive on!\"" Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\n\n\""Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot?

How are you, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""Do you mean me?\"" mutered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n\""Of course I mean you,\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \""Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.\""\n\n\""But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.\""\n\n\""No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""What is happening? What's this?\"" voices were heard in the groop of monks.\n\n\""Let us go,\"" cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\n\n\""No, excuse me,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. \""Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.\""\n\nWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\n\n\""How disgraveful!\"" cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\n\n\""Pardon me!\"" said the Father Superior. \""It was said of old, 'Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.' And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!\"" and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\n\n\""Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's Robbers. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you'll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?\"" He went up to the table. \""Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.\""\n\n\""This is too disgraceful!\"" said Father Iosif.\n\nFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\n\n\""Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.\"" He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. \""This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!\""\n\nIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\n\nThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\n\n\""It is writen again, 'Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.' And so will we.\""\n\n\""Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I've cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.\"" He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\n\nIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\n\n\""Alexey!\"" his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. \""You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.\""\n\nAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. \""I am going with you! \"" he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. \""Take me, too.\""\n\n\""There!\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. \""Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!\""\n\nBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\n\n\""Drive on!\"" Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\n\n\""Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\n\nBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\n\n\""Well, you are a fellow,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\n\nAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, \""Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?\""\n\n\""You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,\"" Ivan snaped sullenly.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\n\n\""A drop of brandy would be nice now,\"" he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\n\n\""You shall have some, too, when we get home.\""\n\nIvan was still silent.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\n\n\""But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.\""\n\nIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.\nMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. \""Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,\"" he reflceted, on the steps. \""And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.\""\n\nHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\n\nThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior's diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\n\nRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\n\n\""We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,\"" began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. \""Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as\"" -- he glanced at the monks -- \""your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.\""\n\nAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\n\n\""I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.\""\n\nHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\n\nIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder's: \""I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.\"" He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, \""Why do you hate so and so, so much?\"" And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, \""I'll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.\""\n\nRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\n\n\""Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,\"" he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, \""Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don't care what they think -- that's all!\""\n\nHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior's. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior's dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. \""They thought I had gone, and here I am again,\"" he cried to the wholle room.\n\nFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\n\n\""No! this I cannot endure!\"" he cried. \""I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!\""\n\nThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n\""What is it he cannot?\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \""that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?\""\n\n\""You are welcome with all my heart,\"" answerred the Superior. \""Gentlemen!\"" he added, \""I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.\""\n\n\""No, no, it is impossible!\"" cryed Miusov, beside himself.\n\n\""Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""Do you mean me?\"" mutered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n\""Of course I mean you,\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \""Who else?

And they did not speek again all the way home.\nMiusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy, could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. \""Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,\"" he reflceted, on the steps. \""And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.\""\n\nHe determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.\n\nThese excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior's diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stainedbut evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sortbut Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.\n\nRakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thinbut still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his handbut the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.\n\n\""We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,\"" began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. \""Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima's cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as\"" -- he glanced at the monks -- \""your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.\""\n\nAs he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.\n\nThe Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:\n\n\""I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.\""\n\nHe stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.\n\nIt was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder's cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder's: \""I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.\"" He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, \""Why do you hate so and so, so much?\"" And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, \""I'll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.\""\n\nRememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.\n\n\""Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,\"" he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, \""Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don't care what they think -- that's all!\""\n\nHe told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior's. He had no clear idea what he would dobut he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenitybut only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior's dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. \""They thought I had gone, and here I am again,\"" he cried to the wholle room.\n\nFor one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.\n\n\""No! this I cannot endure!\"" he cried. \""I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!\""\n\nThe blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.\n\n\""What is it he cannot?\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, \""that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?\""\n\n\""You are welcome with all my heart,\"" answerred the Superior. \""Gentlemen!\"" he added, \""I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.\""\n\n\""No, no, it is impossible!\"" cryed Miusov, beside himself.\n\n\""Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""Do you mean me?\"" mutered Maximov, puzzled.\n\n\""Of course I mean you,\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \""Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.\""\n\n\""But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.\""\n\n\""No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn't he, von Sohn?\""\n\n\""What is happening? What's this?\"" voices were heard in the groop of monks.\n\n\""Let us go,\"" cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.\n\n\""No, excuse me,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. \""Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his wordsbut I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I've been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.\""\n\nWe must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monasterybut in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder's cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.\n\n\""How disgraveful!\"" cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.\n\n\""Pardon me!\"" said the Father Superior. \""It was said of old, 'Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.' And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!\"" and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.\n\n\""Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's Robbers. I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you'll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?\"" He went up to the table. \""Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.\""\n\n\""This is too disgraceful!\"" said Father Iosif.\n\nFather Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.\n\n\""Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan't come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.\"" He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. \""This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!\""\n\nIt must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.\n\nThe Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:\n\n\""It is writen again, 'Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.' And so will we.\""\n\n\""Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I've cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.\"" He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.\n\nIt was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.\n\n\""Alexey!\"" his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. \""You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.\""\n\nAlyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. \""I am going with you! \"" he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. \""Take me, too.\""\n\n\""There!\"" cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. \""Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myselfbut I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!\""\n\nBut Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.\n\n\""Drive on!\"" Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.\n\n\""Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.\n\nBut the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.\n\n\""Well, you are a fellow,\"" Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.\n\nAfter a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, \""Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?\""\n\n\""You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,\"" Ivan snaped sullenly.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.\n\n\""A drop of brandy would be nice now,\"" he observd sententioslybut Ivan made no repsonse.\n\n\""You shall have some, too, when we get home.\""\n\nIvan was still silent.\n\nFyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.\n\n\""But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.\""\n\nIvan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home."",

What though the field be lost?\nAll is not lost; the unconquerable Will,\nAnd study of revenge, immortal hate,\nAnd courage never to submit or yield:\nAnd what is else not to be overcome?\n110That Glory never shall his wrath or might\nExtort from me. To bow and sue for grace\nWith suppliant knee, and deisie his power\nWh, from the terrour of this Arm so late\nDoubted his Empire, that were low indeed,\nThat were an ignominy and shame beneath\nThis downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods\nAnd this Empyreal substance cannot fail,\nSince through experience of this great event\nIn Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc’t,\n120We may with more successful hope resolve\nTo wage by force or guile eternal Warr\nIrreconcileable, to our grand Foe,\nWho now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy\nSole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav’n.\n  So spake th’ Apostate Angel, though in pain,\nVaunting aloudbut rackt with deep despare:\nAnd him thus ansser’d soon his bold Compeer.\n  O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,\nThat led th’ imbattelld Seraphim to Warr\n130Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds\nFearless, endanger’d Heav’ns perpetual King;\nAnd put to proof his high Supremacy,\nWhether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,\nToo well I see and rue the dire event,\nThat with sad overthrow and foul defeat\nHath lost us Heav’n, and all this mighty Host\nIn horrible destruction laid thus low,\nAs far as Gods and Heav’nly Essences\nCan Perish: for the mind and spirit remains\n140Invincible, and vigour soon returns,\nThough all our Glory extinct, and happy state\nHere swallow’d up in endless misery.\nBut what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now\nOf force believe Almighty, since no less\nThen such could hav o’repow’rd such force as ours)\nHave left us this our spirit and strength intire\nStrongly to suffer and support our pains,\nThat we may so suffice his vengeful ire,\nOr do him mightier service as his thralls\n150By right of Warr, what e’re his business be\nHere in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,\nOr do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;\nWhat can it then avail though yet we feel\nStrength undiminisht, or eternal being\nTo undergo eternal punishment?\nWhereto with speedy words th’ Arch-fiend reply’d.\n  Fall’n Cherube, to be weak is miserable\nDoing or Suffering: but of this be sure,\nTo do ought good never will be our task,\n160But ever to do ill our sole delight,\nAs being the contrary to his high will\nWhom we resist. If then his Providence\nOut of our evil seek to bring forth good,\nOur labour must be to pervert that end,\nAnd out of good still to find means of evil;\nWhich oft times may succeed, so as perhaps\nShall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb\nHis inmost counsels from their destind aim.\nBut see the angry Victor hath recall’d\n170His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit\nBack to the Gates of Heav’n: The Sulphurous Hail\nShot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid\nThe fiery Surge, that from the Precipice\nOf Heav’n receiv’d us falling, and the Thunder,\nWing’d with red Lightning and impetuous rage,\nPerhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now\nTo bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.\nLet us not slip th’ occasion, whether scorn,\nOr satiate fury yield it from our Foe.\n180Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,\nThe seat of desolation, voyd of light,\nSave what the glimmering of these livid flames\nCasts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend\nFrom off the tossing of these fiery waves,\nThere rest, if any rest can harbour there,\nAnd reassembling our afflicted Powers,\nConsult how we may henceforth most offend\nOur Enemy, our own loss how repair,\nHow overcome this dire Calamity,\n190What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,\nIf not what resolution from despare.\n  Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate\nWith Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes\nThat sparkling blaz’d, his other Parts besides\nProne on the Flood, extended long and large\nLay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge\nAs whom the Fables name of monstrous size,\nTitanian, or Earth-born, that warr’d on Jove,\nBriarios or Typhon, whom the Den\n200By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast\nLeviathan, which God of all his works\nCreated hugest that swim th’ Ocean stream:\nHim haply slumbring on the Norway foam\nThe Pilot of some small night-founder’d Skiff,\nDeeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,\nWith fixed Anchor in his skaly rind\nMoors by his side under the Lee, while Night\nInvests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:\nSo stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay\n210Chain’d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence\nHad ris’n or heav’d his headbut that the will\nAnd high permission of all-ruling Heaven\nLeft him at large to his own dark designs,\nThat with reiterated crimes he might\nHeap on himself damnation, while he sought\nEvil to others, and enrag’d might ssee\nHow all his malice serv’d but to bring forth\nInfinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn\nOn Man by him seduc’tbut on himself\n220Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour’d.\nForthwith upright he rears from off the Pool\nHis mighty Stature; on each hand the flames\nDrivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld\nIn billows, leave i’th’ midst a horrid Vale.\nThen with expanded wings he stears his flight\nAloft, incumbent on the dusky Air\nThat felt unusual weight, till on dry Land\nHe lights, if it were Land that ever burn’d\nWith solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;\n230And such appear’d in hue, as when the force\nOf subterranean wind transports a Hill\nTorn from Pelorus, or the shatter’d side\nOf thundring Ætna, whose combustible\nAnd fewel’d entrals thence conceiving Fire,\nSublim’d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,\nAnd leave a singed bottom all involv’d\nWith stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole\nOf unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate,\nBoth glorying to have scap’t the Stygian flood\n240As Gods, and by their own recover’d strength,\nNot by the sufferance of supernal Power.\n  Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,\nSaid then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat\nThat we must change for Heav’n, this mournful gloom\nFor that celestial light? Be it so, since hee\nWho now is Sovran can dispose and bid\nWhat shall be right: fardest from him is best\nWhom reason hath equald, force hath made supream\nAbove his equals. Farewel happy Fields\n250Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail\nInfernal world, and thou profoundest Hell\nReceive thy new Possessor: One who brings\nA mind not to be chang’d by Place or Time.\nThe mind is its own place, and in it self\nCan make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n.\nWhat matter where, if I be still the same,\nAnd what I should be, all but less than hee\nWhom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least\nWe shall be free; th’ Almighty hath not built\nHere for his envy, will not drive us hence:\nHere we may reign secure, and, in my choyce\nTo reign is worth ambition though in Hell:\nBetter to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav’n.\nBut wherefore let we then our faithful friends,\nTh’ associates and copartners of our loss\nLie thus astonisht on th’ oblivious Pool,\nAnd call them not to share with us their part\nIn this unhappy Mansion, or once more\nWith rallied Arms to try what may be yet\n270Regaind in Heav’n, or what more lost in Hell?\n  So Satan spake, and him Bëëlzebub\nThus answer’d. Leader of those Armies bright,\nWhich but th’ Omnipotent none could have foyld,\nIf once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge\nOf hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft\nIn worst extreams, and on the perilous edge\nOf battel when it rag’d, in all assaults\nTheir surest signal, they will soon resume\nNew courage and revive, though now they lye\n280Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,\nAs we erewhile, astounded and amaz’d,\nNo wonder, fall’n such a pernicious highth.\n  He scarce had ceas’t when the superior Fiend\nWas moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield\nEthereal temper, massy, large and round,\nBehind him cast; te broad circumference\nHung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb\nThrough Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views\nAt Ev’ning from the top of Fesole,\n290Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands,\nRivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.\nHis Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine\nHewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Masst\nOf some great Ammiral, were but a wand,\nHe walkt with to support uneasie steps\nOver the burning Marle, not like those steps\nOn Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime\nSmote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;\nNathless he so endur’d, till on the Beach\n300Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call’d\nHis Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans’t\nThick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks\nIn Vallombrosa, where th’ Etrurian shades\nHigh overarch’t imbowr; or scatterd sedge\nAfloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm’d\nHath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew\nBusiris and his Memphian Chivalrie,\nWhile with perfidious hatred they pursu’d\nThe Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld"",

Princes, Potentates,\nWarriers, the Flowr of Heav’n, once yours, now lost,\nIf such astonishment as this can sieze\nEternal spirits; or have ye chos’n this place\nAfter the toyl of Battel to repose\n320Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find\nTo slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav’n?\nOr in this abject posture have ye sworn\nTo adore the Conquerour? who now beholds\nCherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood\nWith scatter’d Arms and Ensigns, till anon\nHis swift pursuers from Heav’n Gates discern\nTh’ advantage, and descending tread us down\nThus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts\nTransfix us to the bottom of this Gufle.\n330Awake, arise, or be for ever fall’n.\n  They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung\nUpon the wing, as when men wont to watch\nOn duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,\nRouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.\nNor did they not perceave the evil plight\nIn which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;\nYet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd\nInnumerable. As when the potent Rod\nOf Amrams Son in Egypts evill day\n340Wav’d round the Coast, up call’d a pitchy cloud\nOf Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind,\nThat ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh hung\nLike Night, and darken’d all the Land of Nile:\nSo numberless were those bad Angels seen\nHovering on wing under the Cope of Hell\n’Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;\nTill, as a signal giv’n, th’ uplifted Spear\nOf their great Sultan waving to direct\nTheir course, in even ballance down they light\n350On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;\nA multitude, like which the populous North\nPour’d never from her frozen loyns, to pass\nRhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons\nCame like a Deluge on the South, and spread\nBeneath Gibraltar to the Lybian sands.\nForthwith from every Squadron and each Band\nThe Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood\nTheir great Commander; Godlike shapes and sorms\nExeelling human, Princely Dignities,\n360And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;\nThough of their Names in heavenly Records now\nBe no memorial, blotted out and ras’d\nBy thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.\nNor had they yet among the Sons of Eve\nGot them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,\nThrough Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,\nBy falsities and lyes the greatest part\nOf Mankind they corrupted to forsake\nGod their Creator, and th’ invisible\n370Glory of him, that made them, to transform\nOft to the Image of a Brute, adorn’d\nWith gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,\nAnd Devils to adore for Deities:\nThen were they known to men by various Names,\nAnd various Idols through the Heathen World.\nSay, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,\nRous’d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,\nAt their great Emperors call, as next in worth\nCame singly where he stood on the bare strand,\n380While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?\nThe chief were those who from the Pit of Hell\nRoaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix\nTheir Seats long after next the Seat of God,\nTheir Altars by his Altar, Gods ador’d\nAmong the Nations round, and durst abide\nJehovah thundring out of Sion, thron’d\nBetween the Cherubim; yea, often plac’d\nWithin his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,\nAbominations; and with cursed things\n390His holy Rites and solemn Feasts profan’d,\nAnd with their darkness durst affront his light.\nFirst Moloch, horrid King besmear’d with blood\nOf human sacrifice, and parents tears,\nThough for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud\nTheir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire\nTo his grim Idol. Him the Ammonite\nWorshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain,\nIn Argob' and in Basan, to the stream\nOf utmost Arnon. Nor content with such\n400Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart\nOf Solomon he led by fraud to build\nHis Temple right against the Temple of God\nOn that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove\nThe pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence\nAnd black Gehenna call’d, the Type of Hell.\nNext Chemos, th’ ob’cene dread of Moabs Sons,\nFrom Aroer to Nebo, and the wild\nOf Southmo’t Abarim; in Hesebon\nAnd Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond\n410The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines,\nAnd Eleale to th’ Asphaltick Pool.\nPeor his other Name, when he entic’d\nIsrael in Sittim on their march from Nile\nTo do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.\nYet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg’d\nEven to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove\nOf Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate;\nTill good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.\nWith these came they, who from the bordring flood\n420Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts\nEgypt from Syrian ground, had general Names\nOf Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male,\nThese Feminine. For Spirits when they please\nCan either Sex assume, or both; so soft\nAnd uncompounded is their Essence pure,\nNot ti’d or manacl’d with joynt or limb,\nNor founded on the brittle strength of bones,\nLike cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose\nDilated or condens’t, bright or obscure,\n430Can execute their aerie purposes,\nAnd works of love or enmity fulfil.\nFor those the Race of Israel' oft forsook\nTheir living strength, and unfrequented left\nHis righteous Altar, bowing lowly down\nTo bestial Gods; for which their heads as low\nBow’d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear\nOf despicable foes. With these in troop\nCame Astoreth, whom the Phœnicians called\nAstarte, Queen of Heav’n, with crescent Horns;\n440To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon\nSidonian Virgins paid their Vows and Songs;\nIn Sion also not unsung, where stood\nHer Temple on th’ offensive Mountain, built\nBy that uxorious King, whose heart though large,\nBeguil’d by fair Idolatresses, fell\nTo Idols foul. Thammuz came next behind,\nWhose annual wound in Lebanon allur’d\nThe Syrian Damsels to lament his fate\nIn amorous dittyes all a Summers day,\n450While smooth Adonis from his native Rock\nRan purple to the Sea, suppos’d with blood\nOf Thammuz yearly wounded: the Love-tale\nInfected Sions daughters with like heat,\nWhose wanton passions in the sacred Porch\nEzekiel saw, when by the Vision led\nHis eye survay’d the dark Idolatries\nOf alienated Judah. Next came one\nWho mourn’d in earnest, when the Captive Ark\nMaim’d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off,\n460In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,\nWhere he fell flat, and sham’d his Worshipers:\nDagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man\nAnd downward Fish: yet had his Temple high\nRear’d in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast\nOf Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon,\nAnd Accaron and Gaza’s frontier bounds.\nHim follow’d Rimmon, whose delightful Seat\nWas fair Damascus, on the fertil Banks\nOf Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.\n470He also against the house of God was bold:\nA Leper once he lost and gain’d a King,\nAhaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew\nGods Altar to disparage and displace\nFor one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn\nHis odious offrings, and adore the Gods\nWhom he had vanquisht. After these appear’d\nA crew who under Names of old Renown,\nOsiris, Isis, Orus, and their Train\nWith monstrous shapes and sorceries abus’d\n480Fanatic Egypt and her Priessts, to seek\nThir wandring Gods disguis’d in brutish forms\nRather than human. Nor did Israel scape\nTh’ infection when their borrow’d Gold compos’d\nThe Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King\nDoubl’d that sin in Bethel and in Dan,\nLik’ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,\nJehovah, who in one Night when he pass’d\nFrom Egypt marching, equal’d with one stroke\nBoth her first born and all her bleating Gods.\n490Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd\nFell not from Heaven, or more gross to love\nVice for it self: To him no Temple stood\nOr Altar smoak’d; yet who more oft than hee\nIn Temples and at Altars, when the Priest\nTurns Atheist, as did Ely’s sons, who fill’d\nWith lust and violence the house of God.\nIn Courts and Palaces he also Reigns\nAnd in luxurious Cities, where the noyse\nOf riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,\nAnd injury and outrage: And, when Night\n500Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons\nOf Belial, flown with insolence and wine.\nWitness the Streets of Sodom, and that night\nIn Gibeah, when the hospitable Dores\nYielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.\nThese were the prime in order and in might;\nThe rest were long to tell, though far renown’d,\nTh’ Ionian Gods, of Javans Issue held\nGods, yet confest later than Heav’n and Earth\n510Thir boasted Parents; Titan, Heav’ns first born\nWith his enormous brood, and birthright seis’d\nBy younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove\nHis own and Rhea’s Son like measure found;\nSo Jove usurping reign’d: these first in Creet\nAnd Ida known, thence on the Snowy top\nOf cold Olympus' rul’d the middle Air\nThir highest Heav’n; or on the Delphian Cliff,\nOr in Dodona, and through all the bounds\nOf Doric Land; or who with Saturn old\n520Fled over Adria to th’ Hesperian Fields,\nAnd ore the Celtic roam’d the utmost Isles.\nAll these and more came flocking; but with looks\nDown cast and damp, yet such wherein appear’d\nObscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief\nNot in despair, to have found themselves not lost\nIn loss it self; which on his count’nance cast\nLike doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride\nSoon recollecting, with high words, that bore\nSemblance of worth not substance, gently rais’d\n530Their fainted courage, and dispel’d their fears.\nThen strait commands that at the warlike sound\nOf Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard\nHis mighty Standard; that proud honour claim’d\nAzazel as his right, a Cherube tall:\nWho forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld\nTh’ Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc’t\nShon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind\nWith Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz’d,\nSeraphic arms and Trophies: all the while\n540Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:\nAt which the universal Host upsent\nA shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond\nFrighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night.\nAll in a moment through the gloom were seen\nTen thousand Banners rise into the Air\nWith Orient Colours waving: with them rose\nA Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms\nAppear’d, and serried Shields in thick array\nOf depth immeasurable: Anon they move\n550In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood\nOf Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais’d\nTo highth of noblest temper Hero’s old\nArming to Battel, and in stead of rage\nDeliberate valour breath’d, firm and unmov’d\nWith dread of death to flight or foul retreat,\nNor wanting power to mitigate and swage\nWith solemn touches, troubl’d thoughts, and chase\nAnguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain\nFrom mortal or immortal minds. Thus they\n560Breathing united force with fixed thought\nMov’d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm’d\nThir painful steps o’ere the burnt soyle; and now\nAdvanc’t in view they stand, a horrid Front\nOf dreadful length and dazzling Arms, in guise\nOf Warriors old with order’d Spear and Shield,\nAwaiting what command thir mighty Chief\nHad to impose: He through the armed Files\nDarts his experienc’t eye, and soon traverse\nThe whole Battalion views, thir order due,\n570Thir visages and stature as of Gods,\nThir number last he summs. And now his heart\nDistends with pride, and, hardning in his strength\nGlories: For never since created man,\nMet such imbodied force, as nam’d with these\nCould merit more than that small infantry\nWarr’d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood\nOf Phlegra with th’ Heroic Race were joyn’d\nThat fought at Theb’s and Ilium, on each side\nMixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds\n580In Fable or Romance of Uthers Son\nBegirt with British and Armoric Knights;\nAnd all who since, Baptiz’d or Infidel\nJousted in Aspramont or Montalban,\nDamasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond,\nOr whom Biserta sent from Afric shore\nWhen Charlemain with all his Peerage fell\nBy Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond\nCompare of mortal prowess, yet observ’d\nThir dread Commander: he above the rest\n590In shape and gesture proudly eminent\nStood like a Towr; His form had yet not lost\nAll her Original brightness, nor appear’d\nLess than Arch Angel ruined, and th’ excess\nOf Glory obscur’d: As when the Sun new ris’n\nLooks through the Horizontal misty Air\nShorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon\nIn dim Eclips disastrous twilight s{{ls}heds\nOn half the Nations, and with fear of change\nPerplexes Monarchs. Dark’n’d so, yet shon\n600Above them all th’ Arch Angel: but his face\nDeep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care\nSat on his faded cheekbut under Browes\nOf dauntless courage, and considerate Pride\nWaiting revenge: cruel his eyebut cast\nSigns of remorse and passion to behold\nThe fellows of his crime, the followers rather\n(Far other once beheld in bliss), condemn’d\nFor ever now to have their lot in pain,\nMillions of Spirits for his fault amerc’t\n610Of Heav’n, and from Eternal Splendors flung\nFor his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,\nThir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire\nHath scath’d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,\nWith singed top their stately growth though bare\nStands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar’d\nTo speak; whereat their doubl’d Ranks they bend\nFrom Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round\nWith all his Peers: attention held them mute.\nThrice he assayed, and thrice in spite of scorn,\n620Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last\nWords interwove with sighs found out their way.\n  O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers\nMatchlessbut with th’ Almighthy, and that strife\nWas not inglorious, though th’ event was dire,\nAs this place testifies, and this dire change\nHateful to utter: but what power of mind\nForeseeing or presaging, from the Depth\nOf knowledge past or present, could have fear’d,\nHow such united force of Gods, how such\n630As stood like these, could ever know repulse?\nFor who can yet beleeve, though after loss,\nThat all these puissant Legions, whose exile\nHath emptied Heav’n, shall faile to re-ascend\nSelf-rais’d, and repossess their native seat.\nFor me, be witness all the Host of Heav’n,\nIf counsels different, or danger shun’d\nBy me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns\nMonarch in Heav’n, till then as one secure\nSat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,\n640Consent or custome, and his Regal State\nPut forth at fullbut still his strength conceal’d,\nWhich tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.\nHenceforth his might we know, and know our own\nSo as not either to provoke, or dread\nNew warr, provok’t; our better part remains\nTo work in close design, by fraud or guile,\nWhat force effected not: that he no less\nAt length from us may find, who overcomes\nBy force, hath overcome but half his foe.\n650Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife\nThere went a fame in Heav’n that he ere long\nIntended to create, and therein plant\nA generation, whom his choice regard\nShould favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:\nThither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps\nOur first eruption, thither or elsewhere:\nFor this Infernal Pit shall never hold\nCælestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th’ Abysse\nLong under darkness cover. But these thoughts\n660Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,\nFor who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr\nOpen or understood must be resolv’d.\n  He spake: and, to confirm his words, out-flew\nMillions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs\nOf mighty Cherubim; the ’udden blaze\nFar round illumin’d hell: highly they rag’d\nAgainst the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm’s\nClash’d on their sounding shields the din of war,\nHurling defiance toward the vault of Heav’n.\n670 There tood a Hill not far whose griesly top\nBelch’d fire and rolling smoak; the rest entire\nShon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign\nThat in his womb was hid metallic Ore,\nThe work of Sulphur. Thither wing’d with speed\nA numerous Brigad hasten’d As when bands\nOf Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm’d\nForerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,\nOr cast a Rampart. Mammon led them on,\nMammon, the least erected Spirit that fell\n680From heav’n, for ev’n in heav’n his looks & thoughts\nWere always downward bent, admiring more\nThe riches of Heav’ns pavement, trod’n Gold,\nThan aught divine or holy else enjoy’d\nIn vision beatific: by him first\nMen also, and by his suggestion taught,\nRansack’d the Center, and with impious hands\nRifl’d the bowels of thir mother Earth\nFor Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew\nOp’nd into the Hill a spacious wound\n690And dig’d out ribs of Gold. Let none admire\nThat riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best\nDeserve the pretious bane. And here let those\nWho boast in mortal things, and wondring tell\nOf Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings,\nLearn how their greatest Monuments of Fame,\nAnd Strength and Art, are easily outdone\nBy Spirits reprobate, and in an hour\nWhat in an age they with incessant toyle\nAnd hands innumerable scarce perform.\n700Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar’d,\nThat underneath had veins of liquid fire\nSluc’d from the Lake, a second multitude\nWith wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,\nSevering each kinde, and scum’d the Bullion dross:\nA third as soon had form’d within the ground\nA various mould, and from the boyling cells\nBy strange conveyance fill’d each hollow nook,\nAs in an Organ from one blast of wind\nTo many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.\n710A non out of the earth a Fabrick huge\nRose like an Exhalation, with the sound\nOf Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,\nBuilt like a Temple, where Pilasters round\nWere set, and Doric pillars overlaid\nWith Golden Architrave; nor did there want\nCornice or FrEeze, with bossy Sculptures grav’n,\nThe Roof was fretted Gold. Not Babilon,\nNor great Alcairo such magnificence\nEqual’d in all thir glories, to inshrine\n720Belus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat\nThir Kings, when Ægypt with Assyria strove\nIn wealth and luxurie. Th’ ascending pile\nStood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores\nOp’ning thir brazen soulds discover wide\nWithin, her ample spaces, o’re the smooth\nAnd level pavement: from the arched roof\nPendent by suttle Magic many a row\nOf Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed\nWith Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light\n730As from a sky. The hasty multitude\nAdmiring enter’d, and the work some praise\nAnd some the Architect: his hand was known\nIn Heav’n by many a Towred structure high,\nWhere Scepter’d Angels held their residence,\nAnd sat as Princes, whom the supreme King\nExalted to such power, and gave to rule,\nEach in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.\nNor was his name unheard or unador’d\nIn ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land\n740Men call’d him Mulciber; and how he fell\nFrom Heav’n, they fabl’d, thrown by angry Jove\nSheer o’re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn\nTo Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,\nA Summers day; and with the setting Sun\nDropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,\nOn Lemnos th’ Ægæan Ile: thus they relate,\nErring; for he with this rebellious rout\nFell long before; nor aught avail’d him now\nTo have built in Heav’n high Towrs; nor did he scape\n750By all his Enginsbut was headlong sent\nWith his industrious crew, to build in hell.\nMean while the winged Haralds by command\nOf Sovran power, with awful Ceremony\nAnd Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim\nA solemn Councel forthwith to be held\nAt Pandæmonium, the high Capital\nOf Satan and his Peers: thir summons call’d\nFrom every and Band squared Regiment\nBy place or choice the worthiest; they anon\n760With hundreds and with thousands trooping came\nAttended: all access was throng’d, the Gates\nAnd Porches widebut chief the spacious Hall\n(Though like a cover’d field, where Champions bold\nWont ride in arm’d, and at the Soldans chair\nDefi’d the best of Panim chivalry\nTo mortal combat or carreer with Lance)\nThick swarm’d, both on the ground and in the air,\nBrusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees\nIn spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,\n770Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive\nIn clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers\nFlie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,\nThe suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,\nNew rub’d with Baume, expatiate, and confer\nTheir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd\nSwarm’d and were straitn’d; till the Signal giv’n,\nBehold a wonder! they but now who seemed\nIn bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons\nNow less than smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room\n780Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race\nBeyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie Elves,\nWhose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side\nOr Fountain some belated Peasant sees,\nOr dreams he sees, while over head the Moon\nSits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth\nWheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance\nIntent, with jocond Music charm his ear;\nAt once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.\nThus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms\n790Reduc’d their shapes immense, and were at large,\nThough without number still amidst the Hall\nOf that infernal Court. But far within\nAnd in their own dimensions like themselves\nThe great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim\nIn close recess and secret conclave sat\nA thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat’s,\nFrequent and full. After short silence then\nAnd summons read, the great consult began."",

(CONT'D)\n          I was expecting you some time last week.\n          Not that it matters, you come and go as\n          you please, always have done, always\n          will.\n                    (MORE)\n\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             12.\nCONTINUED:\n                    BILBO (O.S.)

Not\n          much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh\n          no...we're alright...I've just found some\n          sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope\n          it's enough.\n              (comes into view)\n          I could do you some eggs if you like?\n\nBilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf\nmysteriously appears behind him.\n\n                    GANDALF\n          Just tea, thank you.\n\n                       BILBO\n          Oh..right.     You don't mind if...?\n\n                    GANDALF\n          No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud\n          knock on the front door.\n\nMRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.)\n\nBilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there.\n\n                    BILBO\n          I'm not home.\n\nGandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide.\n\n                    BILBO (CONT'D)\n          I've got to get away from these\n          confounded relatives, hanging on the bell\n          all day, never giving me a moment's\n          peace. I want to see mountains\n          again...mountains, Gandalf... and then\n          find somewhere quiet where I can finish\n          my book...Oh, Tea!\n\n                    GANDALF\n          So, you mean to go through with your\n          plan, then?\n\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           13.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                    BILBO\n          Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the\n          arrangements are made.\n\n                    GANDALF\n          Frodo suspects something.\n\n                    BILBO\n          'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not\n          some block headed Bracegirdle from\n          Hardbottle!\n\n                    GANDALF\n          You will tell him, won't you?\n\n                      BILBO\n          Yes, yes.\n\n                    GANDALF\n          He's very fond of you.\n\n                    BILBO\n          I know. He'd probably come with me if I\n          asked him. I think, in his heart,\n          Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the\n          woods and the fields... little rivers.\n          Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen\n          window.\n\n                    BILBO (CONT'D)\n          I am old, Gandalf...

A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through\nthe Center of Bilbo's smoke ring.\n\n                    BILBO (CONT'D)\n          Ohhhh,\n              (smiles)\n          Gandalf my old friend...this will be a\n          night to remember!\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\nEXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON -- NIGHT\n\nBOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above\nHobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding\nbranches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down\nfrom the branches...evaporating just above the up turned\nfaces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and\ndrinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the\ntables are piled high with steaming scones and savories.\nGandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark\nthat dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting\nvisitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo\nnotices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit,\nRosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.\n\n                    FRODO\n          Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.\n\n                     SAM\n               (horrified)\n          I think I'll just have myself another\n          ale.\n\n                    FRODO\n          Oh, no you don't. Go on.\n\nSam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of\nhis hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing\nthrong of dancers.\n\n                                                            15.\n\n\n\nANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE\n\nas he is Swept away.   Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer.\n\n                                                      ANGLE ON:\n\nGandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework\nthat draws gasps of admiration from the party guests.\n\nClose on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a\ngroup of young hobbit children.\n\n                    BILBO\n              (melodramatic)\n          So, there I was...at the mercy of three\n          monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of\n          a troll?

But they spent so long arguing\n          the whether-to's and why-for's that the\n          sun's first light crept over the top of\n          the trees...and turned them all to stone!\n\nSTUNNED GASPS from his young Audience greet his astonishing\nfeat! Close on: MERRY AND PIPPIN, two mischievous Young\nHobbits in their late teens. Pippin scrambles on to the back\nof Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework\n\n                    MERRY\n              (urgent whisper)\n          No, no..the big one...the big one! Pippin\n          grabs a huge rocket. CLOSE ON: FIREWORK\n          FUSE crackles with flame!\n\nMerry is holding out the big rocket...he looks aghast at the\nfizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit.\n\n                    MERRY (CONT'D)\n              (worried whisper)\n          You're supposed to stick it in the\n          ground!\n\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           16.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                    PIPPIN\n          It is in the ground.\n\nMerry fearfully tosses the Rocket to Pippin!    The fuse\nsizzles angrily.\n\n                     MERRY\n          Outside!\n\n                    PIPPIN\n          It was your idea.\n\nPippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry.\nWHOOSH! The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in\na shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening\npower. The ROCKET ZOOMS over the Party..It suddenly bursts\napart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon! Fire\ngushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low\ntowards the startled crowd. Close on: Frodo watches the\nFireworks Dragon with alarm...but Bilbo is oblivious to the\nPanicking crowd and impending danger!\n\n                     FRODO\n          Bilbo!   Watch out for the dragon!!\n\n                    BILBO\n          Dragon? Nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon\n          in these parts for a thousand years!\n\nANGLE ON: FRODO\n\nAs he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon\nroars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express\ntrain! Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents\ncollapse, food flies everywhere. The fireworks dragon turns a\nsomersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang!\nThis gets the biggest Cheer of the night.\n\nANGLE ON: MERRY AND PIPPIN,\n\nclothes and hair smoking.\n\n                    MERRY\n          That was good!\n\n                    PIPPIN\n          Let's get another one!\n\nLARGE HANDS suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears.\nLow angle: Gandalf looking DOWN STERNLY!\n\n\n\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            17.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                    GANDALF\n          Meridoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took...I\n          might have known!\n\n                                                        CUT TO:\n\nMERRY AND PIPPIN\n\nAre leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy\nwater...with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and\nsipping an ale.
