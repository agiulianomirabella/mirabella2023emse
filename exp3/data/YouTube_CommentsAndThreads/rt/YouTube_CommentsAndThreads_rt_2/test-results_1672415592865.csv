I&#39;ve dealt with noisy neighbors, I&#39;ve lived in a neighborhood that inhabited junkies. It had gotten so bad, drug dealers were selling drugs out of a building facing the street and I swear, people were lined up like it was Black Friday. They were so bold as to line up and it wasn&#39;t just your typical looking junkie on the streets. It was men and women with suits and ties, dresses and heels. It was CRAZY. But my family galvanized the neighbors who felt as we did. We organized a community Association. We were ready to face whatever was to come our way. My kids were young at the time. Someone shot through our door. That didn&#39;t stop us. We were determine to change our neighborhood, and we did. Sometimes we must put our fears aside, trust in our GOD and stand up against wrong doing. Might I suggest you complain to the manager, then your community board members, then your congressman/woman. You should not have to live in misery. If all fails, then yeah, you SHOULD move. I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re going through this."",

People who don&#39;t like Brooke will never let her live down her indiscretions. They also refuse to place some of the blame on her cohorts in those acts and refuse to accept the wrong doings of the other people they like includingTaylor, she slept with both of her daughter&#39;s ex, Ridge&#39;s stepson and Brooke&#39;s son all were Rick. She has also had romances with practically every man Brooke has including, Eric &amp; Thorne, she murdered Darla driving totally drunk, then dated her husband, attempted to murder Bill because she thought Steffy was being taken advantage of ( she wasn&#39;t) because she was married to Bill&#39;s son Liam, she got pregnant didn&#39;t know the baby&#39;s daddy and again Steffy questioned her next baby&#39;s daddy Finn because she had cheated on him with Hope&#39;s husband Liam again.Tsylor begged Bill not to turn her in and she left town once again. Taylor being gone a lot of the times especially when they needed her didn&#39;t help her children. I&#39;m sure but she was there thru their formative years.

Eric, Stephanie, Quinn all did messed up stuff. Quinn attempted a few murders, kidnapping all kinds of stuff and after all this murder, and deceit Brooke is given the unworthy honor of being the worst offender, outside of Sheila of course. I don&#39;t think any of these people have a right to judge her the way they do. I don&#39;t think Brooke thought her family was superior, I thought Stefanie thought that. She acted  like her cheating son&#39;s and husband was too good for the women she didn&#39;t like and thought she was better because she was rich and had clout.
