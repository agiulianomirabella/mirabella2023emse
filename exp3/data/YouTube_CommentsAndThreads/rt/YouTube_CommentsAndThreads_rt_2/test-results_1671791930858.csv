En poursuivant leurs activités, elles « contribuent à perpétuer une situation qui porte atteinte au droit à l’autodétermination et aux droits fondamentaux de la population civile palestinienne, notamment par l’exploitation des ressources naturelles, la destruction des biens privés et de l’aide humanitaire, le déplacement forcé de civils et les restrictions de mouvement et d’accès aux besoins et services essentiels ».Sur ce sujet éminemment sensible, plusieurs institutions financières ont réagi avec circonspection à l’interpellation des ONG. « Le cas que vous soulevez a été étudié avec attention par les membres des équipes impliquées dans les décisions relatives à la politique d’investissement responsable.

            ""textDisplay"": ""I was going to say:\n\nThis would never happen in China. And then I thought: Oh wait.....\n\nI mean, yes and no. The motives are different. The ones in South Korea are initiated by private citizens who want to catch some compromising images and footage. Which they can sell to make a profit at the expense of the reputation of the people caught on the footage. Basically, they are selling the reputations of the victims for a profit. Which is unscrupulous, because they are profiting off other people's loss. But they might be the types who feel like their victims deserve it and walk around with a chip on their shoulders. But that's just one dynamic.\n\nIn China, it's just a paranoid government's attempt to protect their lives from a greatly dissatisfied populace. I mean, it's kinda their own fault for taking advantage of the people they rule over. But I'd greatly doubt they'd be interested in the sex lives of the average Chinese. Maybe I'm wrong.

The ones in South Korea are initiated by private citizens who want to catch some compromising images and footage. Which they can sell to make a profit at the expense of the reputation of the people caught on the footage. Basically, they are selling the reputations of the victims for a profit. Which is unscrupulous, because they are profiting off other people's loss. But they might be the types who feel like their victims deserve it and walk around with a chip on their shoulders.

              ""textDisplay"": ""@I Do What I Want No, it doesn't sound naïve at all. It just sounds honest. What have you heard about how things are in China?\n\nActually, it's nothing new. It started from at least as early as the Qin Dynasty. The first emperor of China forcibly united all China under his own authority through the means of total war. To consolidate his power, he obviously had a lot of newly integrated 'citizens' from vanquished states who are hostile and resentful to him for destroying their national identity. For example, I was born in Hunan, which used to be part of the warring state of Chu. We were originally a southward expansion fiefdom that was a frontier marquisate of the Zhou Dynasty, and were powerful enough to be often given the privilege of hegemony over the other states to coordinate the defence of all China.\n\nBut we got a bit too proud for our own good, and eventually, decided to declare ourselves a kingdom on par with our liege, the kings of Zhou. They obviously didn't appreciate that, and labled us as semi barbarous, seeing as we liked to do Chinese culture our own way, integrating the customs of the locals we assimilated. But Qin went further than us. We just wanted to be the best. They wanted EVERYTHING. And one of the advisors of the new king of Qin convinced him it was possible.\n\nLong story short, first, they invited the country hick leaders of Shu, the modern Sichuan province, to see some cows they planned to give them. They made them live sized and painted real gold where the cows' number 2's come out of. These leaders of Shu thought they had a golden duck, so to speak, so got very excited, and quickly agreed to the Qin proposal to build a highway direct from the Qin capital to the Shu capital to transport these gold defecating cows, free of charge. Of course, when the cows arrived, the leaders of Shu were more than a little bit disappointedbut it was all just a pretext to construct a highway to their capital. And by that time, it was too little, too late. After that, the highly militaristic state of Qin simply marched their troops directly into the Shu capital on their newly constructed highway, and Shu was theirs.\n\nThis allowed them to outflank us from two directions. Shu was to our West and Qin was to our North. We tried our bestbut they defeated us. Because we were the biggest force in their way, the rest of China fell very quickly after that. But you can imagine none of the other Chinese States were very happy with this new administrative arrangement.\n\nTo make matters worse, to consolidate power, the emperor of Qin took it upon himself to decide that any books not on war and construction is useless. So all the books of poetry, religious rituals, ethics, philosophy, etc, was burnt to the ground. We all watched helplessly as our own cultures were destroyed. To even sing songs of our native land brought paranoia to the Qin Emperor that it might lead to nostalgia for our past identity and lead to an uprising/rebellion, so that was quashed at the bud. This, of course, led to increased resentment.\n\nEventually, he was overthrown after his death, because his son and grandson could never fill his shoes. And two men from the state of Chu first teamed up against himbut later on, fought against each other for supremacy. That was what we call the Chu-Han contention. Han came out on top.\n\nBut the state of Qin openly spied on the newly conquered citizens, not trusting anyone's loyalty. They also encouraged neighbours to spy on each other and report suspicious activity in for browny points. And if someone started any rebellious activities in your neighborhood, you became under suspicion for not reporting it earlier. This put everyone on their toes.\n\nThings were relaxed during the Han and subsequent Dynastiesbut the mould was set. So nothing the Communists do is actually that new. They are just using cameras and high tech to continue the Qin tradition. Chinese history repeats itself. Before the Communists, it was the warlords era. There's more than a slight resemblance with the warring states there. Except it's the warring states with guns and cannons, not just with swords and arrows and spears and things.\n\nHope that helps to put it all into context. I think Chinese history is poorly known in the West. Otherwise, the parallels between China's past and China's present would be obvious, and Communism wouldn't shoulder quite so great a blame as it does. It's just a different style. But in substance, it's just the reincarnation of the Qin empire."",

These leaders of Shu thought they had a golden duck, so to speak, so got very excited, and quickly agreed to the Qin proposal to build a highway direct from the Qin capital to the Shu capital to transport these gold defecating cows, free of charge. Of course, when the cows arrived, the leaders of Shu were more than a little bit disappointedbut it was all just a pretext to construct a highway to their capital. And by that time, it was too little, too late. After that, the highly militaristic state of Qin simply marched their troops directly into the Shu capital on their newly constructed highway, and Shu was theirs.\n\nThis allowed them to outflank us from two directions. Shu was to our West and Qin was to our North. We tried our bestbut they defeated us. Because we were the biggest force in their way, the rest of China fell very quickly after that. But you can imagine none of the other Chinese States were very happy with this new administrative arrangement.\n\nTo make matters worse, to consolidate power, the emperor of Qin took it upon himself to decide that any books not on war and construction is useless. So all the books of poetry, religious rituals, ethics, philosophy, etc, was burnt to the ground. We all watched helplessly as our own cultures were destroyed. To even sing songs of our native land brought paranoia to the Qin Emperor that it might lead to nostalgia for our past identity and lead to an uprising/rebellion, so that was quashed at the bud. This, of course, led to increased resentment.\n\nEventually, he was overthrown after his death, because his son and grandson could never fill his shoes. And two men from the state of Chu first teamed up against himbut later on, fought against each other for supremacy. That was what we call the Chu-Han contention. Han came out on top.\n\nBut the state of Qin openly spied on the newly conquered citizens, not trusting anyone's loyalty. They also encouraged neighbours to spy on each other and report suspicious activity in for browny points. And if someone started any rebellious activities in your neighborhood, you became under suspicion for not reporting it earlier. This put everyone on their toes.\n\nThings were relaxed during the Han and subsequent Dynastiesbut the mould was set. So nothing the Communists do is actually that new. They are just using cameras and high tech to continue the Qin tradition. Chinese history repeats itself. Before the Communists, it was the warlords era. There's more than a slight resemblance with the warring states there. Except it's the warring states with guns and cannons, not just with swords and arrows and spears and things.\n\nHope that helps to put it all into context. I think Chinese history is poorly known in the West. Otherwise, the parallels between China's past and China's present would be obvious, and Communism wouldn't shoulder quite so great a blame as it does. It's just a different style. But in substance, it's just the reincarnation of the Qin empire."",
