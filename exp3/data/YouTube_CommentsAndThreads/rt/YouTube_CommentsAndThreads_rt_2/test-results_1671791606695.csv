People who don&#39;t like Brooke will never let her live down her indiscretions. They also refuse to place some of the blame on her cohorts in those acts and refuse to accept the wrong doings of the other people they like includingTaylor, she slept with both of her daughter&#39;s ex, Ridge&#39;s stepson and Brooke&#39;s son all were Rick. She has also had romances with practically every man Brooke has including, Eric &amp; Thorne, she murdered Darla driving totally drunk, then dated her husband, attempted to murder Bill because she thought Steffy was being taken advantage of ( she wasn&#39;t) because she was married to Bill&#39;s son Liam, she got pregnant didn&#39;t know the baby&#39;s daddy and again Steffy questioned her next baby&#39;s daddy Finn because she had cheated on him with Hope&#39;s husband Liam again.Tsylor begged Bill not to turn her in and she left town once again. Taylor being gone a lot of the times especially when they needed her didn&#39;t help her children. I&#39;m sure but she was there thru their formative years.
