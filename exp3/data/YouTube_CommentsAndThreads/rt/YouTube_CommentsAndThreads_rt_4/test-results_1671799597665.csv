I suggest you to watch Bill Gaede(Physicist Professor of Rational Science), he touches on the definition of &quot;exist&quot; and separates the fine line between OBJECTS and CONCEPTS. Time is a concept, it does NOT exist, concepts are just relations between 2 or more objects. For something to exist it must be an OBJECT, that which has shape and location. Time does not have shape and location, and math physicists treat a clock as the embodiment of time which is totally irrational. We take our hourglass which is a clock that works specifically through gravity, and show that its the opposite of what Einstein said he predicted. Its not that the clock is faster out there in space, its quite the opposite it runs slower. And if you take that same clock, and you take it to sea level that clock will run faster because it&#39;s closer to gravity and the grains are gonna come out of the little glass container faster. So our clock proves general relativity wrong because it has the opposite effect of what they &quot;predict&quot; as its known. They call it a prediction, well here&#39;s a prediction, I&#39;ll say that my clock runs faster when its at sea level than out there in the middle of space. In fact if you take it further out not a single grain will fall and according to the lunatics of relativity, they would say that time had stopped because they decide everything by measurement. And now if not a single grain falls because there is no gravity out there they say well time has stopped. That&#39;s what they would conclude, that&#39;s their rationale, that&#39;s the way a mathematician thinks. He says oh it goes slower slower slower, and when it goes out there where there is no gravity they say oh it stopped altogether so now time is no longer flowing or it stopped altogether. 🤦"",

Every so often I would notice the city would be saying that, \""Today just flew by\"" or \""The day was just dragging along.\""  How can an entire city complain about the same time paradox unless it was effected by it. Maybe a time distorted bubble the earth passes through in its revolution around the sun. Maybe random waves of time distortion hitting the earth? Maybe they're randomly given off by the sun. Maybe they're from outside our Terran system and reach us in intervals. ???? Ti-i-i-ime, is on my side. Yes, it is!"",
