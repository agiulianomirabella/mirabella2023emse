He showed us true Love. \n\nJohn 3:16 \nFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\n\nBut There's a happy news. He rose up again after three days just as he told. There is no greater blessing than having God as our Father. He's coming back soon. Let's all repent and turn from our old ways and prepare our hearts for him.\n\nThis is the prophecy about the second coming of Jesus\n\nZechariah 13:7 \n“Awake, sword, against my shepherd, against the man who is close to me!” declares the LORD Almighty. “Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the little ones.\n\nThis is the fulfillment of the prophecy. \n\nMatthew 26:31 \n \nThen Jesus told them, “This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: “’I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’\n\nThis happened near 30 AD. \n\nHosea 6:1-2\nCome, let us return to the LORD. He has torn us to pieces but he will heal us; he has injured us but he will bind up our wounds.\nAfter two days he will revive us; on the third day he will restore us, that we may live in his presence.\n\n\n\nIn prophecies 1day is equal to 1000 years. Which means after two thousand years Jesus will return again.\nAnd on the third day which is the 3rd millennium, we will live in his sight. We all know we cannot see God's face and live on Earth. So it's the second coming of Jesus.\n\nLuke 21:11 ►\n\nThere will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven.\n\nMatthew 24:6 \nYou will hear of wars and rumors of warsbut see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happenbut the end is still to come.\n\nWe are the witnesses of all these things. From the death of Jesus to 2030 there are 2000 years.9 years is left until the 2000 years are complete after Jesus's death. Jesus is coming soon. Let's all repent and turn from our old ways and turn to the Lord. \n\nPraise the Lord.\n\nPeace and Love to you all.\n\n\nEaster is pagan, the resurrection day of the Lord is correct and please stop taking the Lord's name in vain like saying omg or using it with a bad word or taking it in anyway that is in vain. Even the devil trembles in his name and we shouldn't use the powerful name like that. For the people who says Jesus is not God here's a verse. \n\nIsaiah 9:6 \nFor to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\n\nGod bless you all.\n\nPlease spread this message to the ends of the world."",

What&#39;s the deal with all this hatred in America.  Everyone is being divided all the time for no reason it&#39;s ridiculous.  I&#39;m a republican and I&#39;m tired of all this division.  Of course I would like my party to be winning but do I care if a Democrat wins instead of a republican, NO!  It doesn&#39;t matter and we need to stop publicizing division within America.  It&#39;s ridiculous and idk how we are going to get anywhere without people understanding both sides of the issues at hand.  I get that late shows need to go with the norm of hating on republicans but come on I haven&#39;t watched a late show video in so long and the first thing I watch is James Corden ripping Republicans a new one?  Is this really what America has come too?  Just hatred for one another over politics?  Can people just grow up and work together to find common ground.  It gets repetitive and annoying.  I think it&#39;s time we get someone in office who is neither a conservative or a liberal just someone who is in the middle who listens to both sides.
