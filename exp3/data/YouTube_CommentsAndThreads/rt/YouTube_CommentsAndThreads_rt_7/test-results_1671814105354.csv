They go back to the shelter for a big list of reasons. The recipient WASNT ASKEF IF THEY EVEN WANT A DOG, poor finances, wrong breed,... The list goes on and on and on. In addition the worst time of yr for RESCUES(NOT SHELTERS!! They shelter exactly NOTHING) is post Xmas. They get FLOODED with unwanted Xmas gift puppies. When one of your unwanted puppies gets returned THEY SLAUGHTER THE OLDEST DOG THERE TO MAKE ROOM!!! What your doing is NOTHING BUT SHAMELESS SELF PROMOTING, AND ITS GETTING OLD DOGS BUTCHERED! Here's an idea, why don't you grow a set and do those segments with abandoned elderly doGs?? Have you were seen an elderly dog that's been abandoned in a shelter?? HAVE YOU??! It will SHATTER YOUE HEART!! Think sink immediately and become completely depressed. They frequently stop eating and starve themselves to death or just lay down and die of a broken heart. This is what's going on behind the scenes of your fucking self promotion. Innocents are being killed so you can pat yourself on the back. How proud you must be!\nDo you even know the difference between a shelter and a rescue? I know for a fact you don't, or you would be doing what your doing. When a shelter advertises for help they say \""must be willing to euthanize doGs and cats\"". Shelters say \""must love animals\"". Shelter will give ANYONE a doG that has $100, including pitfighters. SHELTERS DON'T SCREEN POTENTIAL HOMES. So 2/3 of those puppies your bragging about giving away will be returned and an old doG murdered for ,his spot. RESCUES screen for past experience with the breed, veterinary records to make sure your doG will get regular checkup and shots, income to makes sure ofaffordability, fenced yards,..  Its a long list. Rarely to RESCUE doGs get returned.\nYou want to self promote? Fine, then actually try to help. Tell this story and explain that from now on your advocating the adoption of old doGs. Put them on your show. Then let's see you brag about getting a 100% adoption rate. Do you have the nerve to risk a perfect record. Or do you even actually give a shit about doGs?"",
            ""textOriginal"": ""You have no ideas how PISSED OFF THE RESCUE COMMUNITY IS AT YOU! PUPPIES?! FUCK YOU! I can go to Walmart with a box full and do the same thing you just did in 10 minutes, and the exact same thing will happen. 2/3 will NEVER get a forever home! They go back to the shelter for a big list of reasons. The recipient WASNT ASKEF IF THEY EVEN WANT A DOG, poor finances, wrong breed,... The list goes on and on and on. In addition the worst time of yr for RESCUES(NOT SHELTERS!! They shelter exactly NOTHING) is post Xmas. They get FLOODED with unwanted Xmas gift puppies. When one of your unwanted puppies gets returned THEY SLAUGHTER THE OLDEST DOG THERE TO MAKE ROOM!!! What your doing is NOTHING BUT SHAMELESS SELF PROMOTING, AND ITS GETTING OLD DOGS BUTCHERED! Here's an idea, why don't you grow a set and do those segments with abandoned elderly doGs?? Have you were seen an elderly dog that's been abandoned in a shelter?? HAVE YOU??! It will SHATTER YOUE HEART!! Think sink immediately and become completely depressed. They frequently stop eating and starve themselves to death or just lay down and die of a broken heart.

We have laws that protect those too young to give informed consent for sex and marriage, those too intellectually challenged to give informed consent, as well as those who refuse to give consent but are raped, whether male or female. What happens between consenting adults is a totally different situation. Everyone should have rights except their freedom interferes with another person's rights. The way that we we taught it in Sunday school and secondary school was that one person's rights end where the other fellow's nose begins. Christians supposedly believe in freedom of conscience. In Western industrial nations, we have laws protecting children, the innocent, and consenting adults,  protecting animals from abuse, protecting the environment from toxins in the air, water, and ground that harm humans and animals, laws protecting private property, and so on. A society collectively determines its laws and sometimes laws evolve as society determines they need to change. However, these laws should provide full civil rights for consenting adults and protections in society's best interests. Thus, we have laws regulating everything from the protection of children to traffic laws. Society needs laws but those laws should never interfere with the rights of consenting adults to marry whoever they choose, to have privacy over what they do in their bedrooms, to obtain birth control, and the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. The majority of Western society does not support the sexual exploitation of children or forced marriage. We also don't support civil disabilities against women and girls. We cannot help what other countries do but we can offer freedoms, full civil rights, and laws of protection. Once a religion tries to impose its beliefs upon others, it is in violation of the civil rights of those who disagree with it. As for Christians,  Christ said that we are our brothers keepers, do unto others as you would have them do unto you, and become stewards of the earth. Christ said to render unto God that which is God's and unto caeser that which is Caeser's, in other words, the separation of church and state. Once a Christian church, denomination, or individual    does not follow Christ's teachings in these matters,  they are no longer Christians. They are simply authoritarian busy bodies who have no understanding of Christ's love."",
