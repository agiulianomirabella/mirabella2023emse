            ""textDisplay"": ""The \""MAGA\"" folks who see themselves as some kinds of freedom fighters, some kind of new American Revolution patriots are deluding themselves (and/or have been deluded into it by othersbut the responsibility for believing those others ultimately falls back on themselves). ¬†\nThe \""freedoms\"" they claim are \""under attack\"" are not what they think. ¬†\nSure, you have freedom of religion to worship as *you* please.  But that does not give you tie right to force those beliefs on other people.  (See: homosexuality, marriage equality, etc.).¬†\nMask-wearing during the pandemic was not \""the boot of Big Government trampling our freedoms.\""  It was the entire scientific community of the globe saying how mask-wearing was necessary for public health and safety. ¬†China has gone too far in their policies, and their people are responding.  But America was not doing that; they were protecting public health.  Things could have been so much worse.  (Things could have been so much better if we actually had a government in place that truly cared about people and science when it started!)\nThe freedom of fair elections was not compromised because your candidate didn't win.  Election fraud looks like: gerrymandering, voter intimidation, JimCrow-style fees and ID rules and restricted polling times and places.  Elections are supposed to be available to all adults of voting age, not just the voters you want.  Republicans have said- out loud, on paper, in recordings, not even hiding it: \""We don't want everyone to vote, because when everyone votes, we lose.\""  Democrats- as a whole group, not perfect- but their platform and the policies they have tried to implement regarding voting rights: they consistently want to make sure that every eligible person has the right and the opportunity to vote.  Even those who don't vote Democrat: they should have that right.  Republicans consistently try to usurp voting rights, saving them for only the voters that support them.  That is not freedom.\n\nA hundred years ago, the power of social influence was in the newspapers.  1920s newspaper moguls had the power of headlines, editorials, candidates could be lifted up or smeared by the media, mostly in the form of newspapers.  Those who controlled the papers had a great deal of political influence.  (Films like \""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\"" and \""Citizen Kane\"" dealt with these topics.). Today, \""The Media\"" includes newspapers to a much smaller extentbut has added radio, television, and social media.  In theory, the advent of The Internet could have been a very flattening effect: everyone's voice can be heard, even the previously powerless.  And we have seen that used for good causes, like #BLM and others.  But, naturally, the powerful can not abide that being the case, so they set out to make sure that they could concentrate their power and exert their influence.  Zuckerberg, Musk, etc.  Also, the problem with \""everyone's\"" voice being equal is that even the ignorant and the hateful have a voice.

            ""textOriginal"": ""The \""MAGA\"" folks who see themselves as some kinds of freedom fighters, some kind of new American Revolution patriots are deluding themselves (and/or have been deluded into it by othersbut the responsibility for believing those others ultimately falls back on themselves). ¬†\nThe \""freedoms\"" they claim are \""under attack\"" are not what they think. ¬†\nSure, you have freedom of religion to worship as *you* please.  But that does not give you tie right to force those beliefs on other people.  (See: homosexuality, marriage equality, etc.).¬†\nMask-wearing during the pandemic was not \""the boot of Big Government trampling our freedoms.\""  It was the entire scientific community of the globe saying how mask-wearing was necessary for public health and safety. ¬†China has gone too far in their policies, and their people are responding.  But America was not doing that; they were protecting public health.  Things could have been so much worse.  (Things could have been so much better if we actually had a government in place that truly cared about people and science when it started!)\nThe freedom of fair elections was not compromised because your candidate didn't win.  Election fraud looks like: gerrymandering, voter intimidation, JimCrow-style fees and ID rules and restricted polling times and places.  Elections are supposed to be available to all adults of voting age, not just the voters you want.  Republicans have said- out loud, on paper, in recordings, not even hiding it: \""We don't want everyone to vote, because when everyone votes, we lose.\""  Democrats- as a whole group, not perfect- but their platform and the policies they have tried to implement regarding voting rights: they consistently want to make sure that every eligible person has the right and the opportunity to vote.  Even those who don't vote Democrat: they should have that right.  Republicans consistently try to usurp voting rights, saving them for only the voters that support them.  That is not freedom.\n\nA hundred years ago, the power of social influence was in the newspapers.  1920s newspaper moguls had the power of headlines, editorials, candidates could be lifted up or smeared by the media, mostly in the form of newspapers.  Those who controlled the papers had a great deal of political influence.  (Films like \""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\"" and \""Citizen Kane\"" dealt with these topics.). Today, \""The Media\"" includes newspapers to a much smaller extentbut has added radio, television, and social media.  In theory, the advent of The Internet could have been a very flattening effect: everyone's voice can be heard, even the previously powerless.  And we have seen that used for good causes, like #BLM and others.  But, naturally, the powerful can not abide that being the case, so they set out to make sure that they could concentrate their power and exert their influence.  Zuckerberg, Musk, etc.  Also, the problem with \""everyone's\"" voice being equal is that even the ignorant and the hateful have a voice.

Now I want to open your eyes to something very hard for most to see.  It is the realistic view of the reality that surrounds us, untainted or unobscured by the social influences that mold our thinking into today's flavor of who or what we are and the purpose behind our existence.  Here's the deal Fender.  We humans have enough of a brain to realize the predicament we were born into.  The same applies to the thousands of past generations of our fellow humans who landed here before us.  It doesn't take long to realize that life stinks.  I mean you are born into a situation where things around you appear bent upon killing you the sooner the better.  Disease will take some of us out quickly while others might need to wait for the psycho who lives in the neighborhood.  Life is a constant struggle to survive with the odds against us in a game we are destined to eventually lose.  So for hundreds of thousands of years, generations upon generations have been trying to use the only tool it can to address humanity's rather ominous fate.  What if we and they simply use our imagination to come up with a better story with a better ending that makes life more palatable.  Wait, I got it.  How about if we pretend we are not who we know ourselves to be but something better.  Something more important where we can be the hero in the story.  We can even give ourselves a noble purpose that can provide a sense of meaning to our lives so we know what goals we can work towards to gain the eternal reward of never having to die.  Enter religion.  Great stories honed by some fairly creative guys.  I emphasize \""guys\"" since no girls would have ever written themselves into a subservient role in this make-believe play about humanity getting caught up in some eternal war between forces of good and evil.  The point of all of this is that religion is just a game that everyone is supposed to play together.  I chose not to play though I do not really fault you if you really enjoy the game.  You certainly have a right to live your life the way you want to in order to achieve your goals of maximum fun or pleasure while at the same time minimizing pain.  The bottom line is that it is sort of a waste of time for us to continue this discussion since I don't really want to change your mind if you are indeed happy with the sense of purpose that religion gives you.  I doubt I could even if I wanted to.  What I can do is wish you well on your journey even though we will both eventually be forced to return to the same nothingness from which we came no matter what anyone believes.  Live a good life and try not to hurt others too much."",
