            ""textDisplay"": ""Transcript of President John F. Kennedy's Inaugural Address (1961)\nprint-friendly version\nVice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, Reverend Clergy, fellow citizens:\n\nWe observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom--symbolizing an end as well as a beginning--signifying renewal as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forbears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.\n\nThe world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe--the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.\n\nWe dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.\n\nLet every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\n\nThis much we pledge--and more.\n\nTo those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided there is little we can do--for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.\n\nTo those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom--and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.\n\nTo those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required--not because the communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votesbut because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.\n\nTo our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge--to convert our good words into good deeds--in a new alliance for progress--to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty. But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. And let every other power know that this Hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house.\n\nTo that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support--to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective--to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak--and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.\n\nFinally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\n\nWe dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\n\nBut neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course--both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war.\n\nSo let us begin anew--remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.\n\nLet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.\n\nLet both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms--and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.\n\nLet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce.\n\nLet both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah--to \""undo the heavy burdens . . . (and) let the oppressed go free.\""\n\nAnd if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of powerbut a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved.\n\nAll this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.\n\nIn your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.\n\nNow the trumpet summons us again--not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need--not as a call to battle, though embattled we are-- but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, \""rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation\""--a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself.\n\nCan we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?\n\nIn the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility--I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it--and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.\n\nAnd so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country.\n\nMy fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for youbut what together we can do for the freedom of man.\n\nFinally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His helpbut knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own."",

Haspel played a role in the destruction of 92 interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and at other secret agency locations\n\nJoe Biden has close ties with the KKK: he is close friends and praised/admired KKK leaders like Robert Byrd, Strom Thurmond, and James Eastland. Joe Biden even bragged about these relationships with segregationists, just a few: Robert Byrd, Strom Thurmond, and James Eastland. Byrd once led a KKK chapter with 150 members. \n\nIlhan Omar\nJust read about the fraud of the Democrats with the ballots (Republican votes) back in 2016. Read about the fraud by Democrat Ilhan Omar. \""Cash-for-votes\"" was her program. It is all about the fraud with Project Veritas. This is not the first time the former secretary of state has been linked to a pay-to-play scandal. Her critics say, donors—many of them foreign governments—gave money to the family charity in exchange for access to Bill or Hillary Clinton, or possibly preferential treatment from the U.S. State Department during her 2009-2013 tenure.\n\nJoe Biden and sons\nPresident Donald Trump suggested that Hunter Biden had used his position as then-Vice President Joe Biden’s son to secure a $1.5 billion deal with the Chinese state bank for a Chinese private equity company where he is a board member. The $1.5 billion appears to refer to a sum that BHR, the private equity firm, was trying to raise in 2014 to invest outside China, according to The Wall Street Journal. And this after Joe Biden's second son and lawyer Hunter Biden was hired in 2014 for a very high salary (US$ 3.5 million) as a director of the corrupt Ukrainian gas company Burisma, although he would not have any qualifications for the position in that country. At the same time, his father (Joe Biden) manifests as the then Vice President of the United States and engulfed itself politically in Ukraine by forcing the resignation of a corrupt attorney general that was investigating Burisma for fraud (Quid pro quo).\n\nBenghazi\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton fields questions from House lawmakers on the 2012 Benghazi attack that left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens."",

Haspel has attracted controversy for her role as chief of a CIA black site in Thailand in 2002 in which prisoners were tortured with so-called \""enhanced interrogation techniques\"", including waterboarding. Haspel played a role in the destruction of 92 interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of detainees both at the black site she ran and at other secret agency locations\n\nJoe Biden has close ties with the KKK: he is close friends and praised/admired KKK leaders like Robert Byrd, Strom Thurmond, and James Eastland. Joe Biden even bragged about these relationships with segregationists, just a few: Robert Byrd, Strom Thurmond, and James Eastland. Byrd once led a KKK chapter with 150 members. \n\nIlhan Omar\nJust read about the fraud of the Democrats with the ballots (Republican votes) back in 2016. Read about the fraud by Democrat Ilhan Omar. \""Cash-for-votes\"" was her program. It is all about the fraud with Project Veritas. This is not the first time the former secretary of state has been linked to a pay-to-play scandal. Her critics say, donors—many of them foreign governments—gave money to the family charity in exchange for access to Bill or Hillary Clinton, or possibly preferential treatment from the U.S. State Department during her 2009-2013 tenure.\n\nJoe Biden and sons\nPresident Donald Trump suggested that Hunter Biden had used his position as then-Vice President Joe Biden’s son to secure a $1.5 billion deal with the Chinese state bank for a Chinese private equity company where he is a board member. The $1.5 billion appears to refer to a sum that BHR, the private equity firm, was trying to raise in 2014 to invest outside China, according to The Wall Street Journal. And this after Joe Biden's second son and lawyer Hunter Biden was hired in 2014 for a very high salary (US$ 3.5 million) as a director of the corrupt Ukrainian gas company Burisma, although he would not have any qualifications for the position in that country. At the same time, his father (Joe Biden) manifests as the then Vice President of the United States and engulfed itself politically in Ukraine by forcing the resignation of a corrupt attorney general that was investigating Burisma for fraud (Quid pro quo).\n\nBenghazi\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton fields questions from House lawmakers on the 2012 Benghazi attack that left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens."",

            ""textDisplay"": ""The slant from CBS is so pathetic.  Why was Fort Sumter fired upon?  How many people were killed at Fort Sumter?   Fort Sumter was fired upon because Abraham Lincoln, THE DAY AFTER the Senate adjourned until July 4th (the House of Representatives adjourned until July 4th on March 2nd) Lincoln immediately began his plan to violate the armistice.   The U.S. Army was still in Fort Sumter in April, 1861,  South Carolina seceded on December 20th, 1860.  U.S. Army PAWNS were kept in South Carolina and Florida.  They were pawns, that's what the United States used them for.  \n\nHow many people were killed at Fort Sumter?   ZERO!  The bombardment was to force a surrender, and Major Anderson did surrender.  And lets keep this in perspective.  Major Anderson was an Artillery instructor at West Point.   The bombarding him was his assistant artillery instructor at West point (General Beauregard).  They knew one another well.  When the barracks caught on fire, General Beauregard offered his fire brigade.   The South had no desire for a war, and for good reason,  the population of the seceded states was 5 million compared to the 26 million who didn't secede.  The South wanted to be left alone.  Lincoln very purposefully started the war.    \n\nAnd the South didn't secede because of slavery, the South seceded because of  a Northern dominated government that refused to follow the Constitution.  A Northern dominated government that used Southern tax dollars for Northern infrastructure. A Northern dominated government that used tariffs to force the South to purchase northern goods.    \n\nTo say that the South seceded because of slavery is as shallow as saying the North invaded the South to free the slaves.  Yes, you can read over a dozen reasons why the south seceded and cherry pick the word slavery a few times, anyone can do that with any subject.   The North was encouraging radical abolitionist.   And when I say radical abolitionist, I'm not talking about little sweet church ladies trying their best to help the slaves.   I'm talking about John Brown, the murderer who was arrested by Colonel Robert E. Lee.  John Brown was hung for his crimes.  They made him a legend, a saint, wrote songs of him.  That is madness.  Demonizing the South and making it fashionable to hate the South, even to this very day.    \n\n\nIf the righteous Yankee was so concerned about slavery, why didn't they follow the United States Constitution and propose an amendment to end slavery?   I'll tell you why, because they were too busy writing an amendment to protect the institution of slavery.  The Corwin amendment passed both houses on March 2, 1861,  two days before Lincoln's inauguration, and five weeks before the war started.    A Northern dominated congress passed the amendment onto the States.   Don't make excuses for this bizarre behavior,  see it for what it is.   And Abraham Lincoln absolutely embraced this proposed amendment.  Two days after it passed, he has this to say in his first inaugural address. \n\n\n\n\""I understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution which amendment, however, I have not seen has passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States, including that of persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable.\""--Abraham Lincoln, first inaugural address\n\nAnd tell me, does this sound like a leader of an \""abolitionist party\"" (republican)? \n \""I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.\""--Abraham Lincoln, 1858 \n\n\nLincoln was a tyrannical clown.  He was deified when he was assassinated. They made him into a god of sorts.  All one need to do is look at his actions.  He very purposefully started the war.\nLincoln illegally suspended the writ of habeas corpus, shutdown 300 Northern news papers, arrested over 10 thousand people who disagree with him,  arrested the Maryland Legislature,  deported a United States Congressman.  Created the war that killed 2% of the entire population of America, to include 50,000 Southern civilians.     This is the Yankee hero. The one who sent 360,000 union troops to their death, and would have sent a million more if needed.  \n\nThe War was about money, power and control.  Isn't that what every war is about?    \n\nImagine what would have happened if the South would have been left alone.  The South with all of those ports and cash crops, trading with the entire world.   Washington DC would be powerless.  Any attempt to rule over the people would cause more States to leave the union.  States would join the Confederate States of America, and both the C.S.A and U.S.A would know that the Union is fragile and can only be held together by reverence to its Constitution."",
