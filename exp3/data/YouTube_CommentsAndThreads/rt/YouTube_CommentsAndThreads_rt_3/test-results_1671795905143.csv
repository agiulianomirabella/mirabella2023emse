              ""textOriginal"": ""Anne Boleyn, as portrayed in this series (and in most others, come to that), is an ambitious, social-climbing, gold-digging, murderous and vindictive tart. In many ways, she was a female Henry VIII. Beautiful costumes cannot conceal a black heart.\n\nHenry, at least, was once much more affable and considered excellent company. His anger and bitterness were the result of his desperate search for an heir, marital troubles, and ultimately his own failing health. What was Anne's excuse?"",

The go places, do stuff, eat food, Stephen gets gifts, the Gentleman goes hunting etc. The scenes with the Gentleman are often played off as black humour, for example there's a hilarious moment where the Gentleman is monologuing about how he can drive a person mad with a carpet and Stephen is trying very hard to damage control and prevent the fairy from killing people by telling the carpet seller that they're not interested in buying the carpets. Since Stephen's pretty persuasive, he usually steers the Gentleman off murder.\r\n\nBut then Lady Pole's right in front of him, the Gentleman's one step away from killing her and Stephen has the power to stop the Gentleman.

He is incapable of perceiving morality as a human would and thus fails to rationalise the consequences of his actions as his understanding of human nature is inadequate. The book version is also friends with Arabella (she recounts many entertaining conversations with him with her husband) whilst the television version is not. The book version is possessed of a significantly more affable personality and is quite superficially charming but is also very narcissistic. He cannot comprehend that which does not have a relation to himself but he does intend to do good  to people he likes and as Stephen says, he intended nothing but a kindness. The book version believes that by taking his friends away to Lost-hope he is doing them a favour and therefore would not ever consider removing the enchantment. In contrast, his television portrayal is perfectly capable of understanding that the presence of the enchantment is upsetting and tries to manipulate everything in his own favour. The television portrayal is not mad, he is perfectly aware of what he is doing.\n\nThe book version also has a very unstable mood. He changes from murderous rage to happiness and from fear to rage in an instant and some incredibly mundane conversation can quickly turn to murder in addition to perceiving any small slight as murder whereas the television version is incredibly calm and controlled unless pushed severely so you cannot particularly compare the lore drawn from the book to the show."",
