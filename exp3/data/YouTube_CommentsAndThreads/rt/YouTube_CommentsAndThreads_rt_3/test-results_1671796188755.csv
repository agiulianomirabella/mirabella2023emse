I had many reasons to procrastinatebut basically, out of fear of the test, the prep, and a few dozen lame excuses, I chose to ignore my doctor. It wasn’t until my husband dared me in front of my doctor that I agreed to the test. To make a long story short, at the age of 52 in Tx, I was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer. My fear of radiation and chemotherapy was nothing compared to my fear of dying from pancreatic cancer! I was fortunate. My cancer was in the early stages, and this Herbal medication offered me a cure.How did this happened! After the diagnosis report was scared of all the news I was hearing about all the chemo and radiation so that’s when I went online to know more about Pancreatic until I saw a post on YouTube about Dr. Harvey herbal world because I was so desperate and needed to get rid of this so contacted him on WhatsApp and we talked and I explained to him my pancreatic story so he told me that I will be cured and it sounds odd to me like is that really cure so I told my husband about it and we decided to give a try and ordered for it and gave me instructions on how to go about it which I did. The Herbal medications was honestly not bad. The medication was accompanied by a diet plan that made me wonder, and a little nap that make you genuinely generate strength “Is that all there is to it?”Two weeks later my pancreatic cancers turned out to be nothing and went for test and the cancer was completely reversed was healed perfectly. The moral of my story is if I had waited until it got worse too extreme or i had kept procrastinating, it would have been too late.\nYour herbal Propolis Lecithin Capsules is simply the very best solution to my cancer, and you had the science to back it up. I thought I’d be stuck with cancer forever. But now I’ve been cancer free for almost 5 months. My doctor was shocked when I told him that I hadn’t needed a checkup for weeks.

Figure out who you can’t criticize. There are laws on the books right now that make it _iIIegaI_ to question the officiaI narrative of a historicaI event, punishable by imprisonment. There are even laws in the USA against those who choose to boycott a very specific country, and only that country.

His last name even serves as a warning to all about what a crazy psychopathic nutbag he is (part of the name is “yahoo!”)...

              ""textOriginal"": ""@89792131121607920 math is cool \nNot just Google - Wikipedia, Quora, Reddit, Yelp, obviously the social media companies like Twitter/Facebook/etc, etc etc etc - everything you can think of for digital platforms are all owned/ran/edited/etc by the same tribe (just as they did for tv, movie, and print media). \n\nIf you dare post anything that goes against their official narrative / establishment narratives, your commentary will either be deIeted, banned/bIocked from further commenting, or you will be massively attacked/discredited/“debunked”/ridiculed/shamed/etc etc, or a combination thereof.\n\nIt’s pure Communism at this point. And if people have yet to figure out who was actually behind Communism by now, and how eviI it was for us to aid these people in WWI WWII, then they will be totally clueless and in the dark as to what is going in right now!  \n\nWant to know who rules over you? Figure out who you can’t criticize. There are laws on the books right now that make it _iIIegaI_ to question the officiaI narrative of a historicaI event, punishable by imprisonment. There are even laws in the USA against those who choose to boycott a very specific country, and only that country. To even question anything these people do is _UNACCEPTABLE_ (or so we are told). \n\nIt should be of no surprise that the current vaxxx for this BS “CV-l9” is being developed in the very country we aren’t allowed to criticize (even though they mass spy on us, have attacked us multiple times [i.e. Sept 2001 is just one of the times], steal from us, sell our stolen tech to other countries, siphon trillions of dollars off of us, etc etc etc.\n\nDid I mention that the leader of this country that we can’t criticize publicly stated that he wants to microchip kids returning to school from the lockdown? His last name even serves as a warning to all about what a crazy psychopathic nutbag he is (part of the name is “yahoo!”)...
