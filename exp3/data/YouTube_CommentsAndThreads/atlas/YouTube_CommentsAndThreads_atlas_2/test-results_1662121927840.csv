God, I miss the screaming. {Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.} You&#39;ll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He&#39;s got a little job to do inside the dark forest. {Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.} A sorry lot this, Hagrid.

That&#39;s unicorn&#39;s blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one&#39;s been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees.

It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHarry: But who would choose such a life?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirenze: Can you think of no one?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHarry: Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirenze: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHarry: The Philosopher&#39;s Stone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSuddenly, a dog (Fang) barks.

He&#39;s living off the unicorns. Don&#39;t you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn&#39;t want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again.

It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHermione: What is it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHarry: Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn&#39;t I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHagrid: I don&#39;t know. I never saw his face.

How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you&#39;re in the trade? But I told him. I said, &quot;The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him.

He rarely left me alone. {Quirrell turns back to the mirror and Harry&#39;s scar hurts.} But he doesn&#39;t understand. I&#39;m never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do?

Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn&#39;t bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother.

            ""textOriginal"": ""Scene:\n\nA neighbourhood on a street called Privet Drive. An owl, sitting on the street sign flies off to reveal a mysterious appearing old man walking through a forest near the street. He stops at the start of the street and takes out a mechanical device and zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. The man, ALBUS DUMBLEDORE, looks down at the cat, which is a tabby and is sitting on a brick ledge.\n\n \n\nDumbledore: I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.\n\n \n\nThe cat meows, sniffs out and the camera pans back to a wall. The cats shadow is seen progressing into a human. There are footsteps and MINERVA MCGONAGALL is revealed.\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?\n\n \n\nDumbledore: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.\n\nMcGonagall: And the boy?\n\nDumbledore: Hagrid is bringing him.\n\nMcGonagall: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\n\nAlbus: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.\n\n \n\nThere is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man, RUBEUS HAGRID, takes off his goggles.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.\n\nDumbledore: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?\n\nHagrid: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.\n\n \n\nHagrid hands a baby in a blanket over to Dumbledore.\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: Albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are\n\nDumbledore: The only family he has.\n\n \n\nThey stop outside a house.\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.\n\nDumbledore: Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.\n\n \n\nHagrid coughs and sniffles, he is crying. He clears his throat.\n\n \n\nDumbledore: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all.\n\n \n\nHagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door. The baby has a visible lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.\n\n \n\nDumbledore: Good luck...Harry Potter.\n\n \n\nThe camera pans into the scar and the opening title shows:\n\nHARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE\n\n\nAlmost ten years after the: DURSLEY's home. The camera pans on a sleeping boy, almost eleven, with a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.\n\nThere is a click, and knocking. Outside, a tall woman, PETUNIA DURSLEY, raps the door.\n\n \n\nPetunia: Up. Get up. {Knocks} {sighs} Now! {Smacks door of closet which is the boys bedroom}\n\n \n\nA large, tubby boy, DUDLEY DURSLEY, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet. He stops half-way down and goes back, jumping on the staircase.\n\n \n\nDudley: Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!\n\n \n\nDudley laughs, comes down the stairs and runs for the kitchen. The boy, HARRY POTTER, tries to come out of the closetbut is pushed back in by Dudley.\n\n \n\nPetunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley has gone.\n\n \n\nPetunia: Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!\n\n \n\nA larger man, VERNON DURSLEY, is sitting at the kitchen table.\n\n \n\nVernon: Happy birthday, son.\n\n \n\nPetunia and Dudley giggle together. Harry comes into the kitchen, dressed in rags.\n\n \n\nPetunia: Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.\n\nHarry: Yes, Aunt Petunia.\n\n \n\nHe sets to work.\n\n \n\nPetunia: I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.\n\nVernon: Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!\n\nHarry: Yes, Uncle Vernon.\n\n \n\nPetunia leads Dudley over to the family room, where there are a vast amount of presents. Dudley stares.\n\n \n\nDudley: How many are there?\n\nVernon: Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.\n\nDudley: Thirty-six?! But last year last year I got thirty-seven!!\n\nVernon: Yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year!\n\nDudley: I don't care how big they are!\n\nPetunia: Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, Pumpkin?\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nOutside, morning. The happy family is heading to the car. Harry goes to get in but is stopped by Vernon.\n\n \n\nPetunia: This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.\n\nVernon: I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nThe zoo. The family is in the reptile house, looking at a large BOA CONSTRICTOR.\n\n \n\nDudley: Make it move.\n\nVernon raps the glass of the cage.\n\n \n\nVernon: Move!\n\n \n\nDudley raps the glass much harder, and Vernon winces.\n\n \n\nDudley: MOVE!\n\nHarry: He's asleep!\n\nDudley: He's boring.\n\n \n\nDudley and his parents retreat to another enclosure. Harry is left with the snake.\n\n \n\nHarry: Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.\n\n \n\nThe snake looks up and blinks.\n\n \n\nHarry: Can you...hear me? {The snake nods} It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? {The snake shakes its head} You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? {The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity} I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.\n\n \n\nThe now awake snake has attracted Dudley's attention. He rips over to the cage, knocking Harry to the floor.\n\n \n\nDudley: Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!!\n\n \n\nDudley puts his hands on the glass wall. Harry, from the ground, glares at him. Suddenly, the glass disappears. Dudley wretches forward.\n\n \n\nDudley: Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!\n\n \n\nDudley falls into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water. The snake gets out of the exhibit, stopping in front of Harry.\n\n \n\nSnake: Thankssssssss.\n\nHarry: Anytime.\n\n \n\nThe snake starts off.\n\n \n\nMan: SNAKE!\n\n \n\nThere is a lot of screaming as the snake heads for freedom. Dudley gets up to get outbut the glass is now back over the enclosure. He is stuck. He pounds the glass.\n\n \n\nDudley: Mum, mummy!\n\nPetunia: {Sees him} AHH!\n\nDudley: Mum, help! Help me!\n\nPetunia: My darling boy! How did you get in there?!\n\nHarry: {Grins and giggles}\n\n \n\nVernon glares down at him and Harry's grin disappears. Petunia continues screaming: How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nBack at the Dursley's. Petunia and a bundled up Dudley come in.\n\nPetunia: It's all right. It's all right.\n\n \n\nThey disappear around the corner. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slams the door and shoves Harry against a wall, taking his hair.\n\n \n\nHarry: Ow!\n\nVernon: What happened?\n\nHarry: I swear I don't know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!\n\nVernon: {Scoffs and shoves Harry into the closet} There's no such thing as magic!\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nOutside, some time later. An owl flies by the house and drops a letter, which zooms in the letterbox. It lands away from the house and hoots.\n\nHarry, inside, goes to collect the mail. He sorts through the letters and sees his, addressed to him. He goes into the kitchen, hands Vernon the rest of the mail, and walks around the other side of the table to see his letter.\n\n \n\nVernon: Ah, Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.\n\nDudley: {Sees Harrys letter. He runs and grabs it} Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!!\n\nHarry: Hey, give it back! It's mine!\n\nVernon: {Laughs} Yours? Who'd be writing to you?\n\n \n\nThe family gathers to look at the address. There is a broken seal on the letter. The family looks up and Harry gulps.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nAnother owl flies by with a letter and drops it off. Inside, Vernon grabs a handful of letters and rips them up.\n\nIn the closet, Harry hears a whirring noise. He looks out at Vernon drilling wood over the letterbox opening.\n\n \n\nVernon: No more mail through this letterbox.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nOutside, Vernon and Petunia appear. Vernon is about to head off to work. Petunia kisses his cheek.\n\n \n\nPetunia: Have a lovely day at the office, dear.\n\n \n\nShe stops, looks and sees a bunch of owls.\n\n \n\nVernon: Shoo! Go on!\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nInside. Vernon is tossing letters into the fireplace. Harry comes around the corner. Vernon grins evilly and tosses more in.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nLiving/Family room. The family is sitting around, Harry is serving cookies.\n\n \n\nVernon: Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?\n\n \n\nDudley shrugs.\n\n \n\nHarry: {Hands cookie to Vernon} Because there's no post on Sunday? Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Hah! No blasted letters today. No, sir. {Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.} No sir, not one blasted, miserable---\n\n \n\nA letter shoots out of the fireplace and zips across Vernons face. There is a rumbling and then zillions of letters come shooting out of the fireplace.\n\n \n\nDudley: AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! {He jumps on Petunias lap}\n\nPetunia and Vernon: {Screaming}\n\nVernon: Go away, ahh!\n\nDudley: What is it? Please tell me what's happening!\n\n \n\nHarry jumps onto the coffee table to grab a letter. He gets one and starts to run away. Vernon jumps up as well.\n\n \n\nVernon: Give me that! Give me that letter!\n\n \n\nHe chases Harry and grabs him before Harry gets into his closet.\n\n \n\nHarry: Get off! Ahh!\n\nVernon: Ahh!\n\nHarry: They're my letters! Let go of me!\n\nVernon: That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!\n\nDudley: Daddy's gone mad, hasnt he?!\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nA house, on a rock island somewhere out at sea. The family is sleeping, with Harry on the cold, dirt floor. He has drawn a birthday cake which reads, Happy Birthday Harry. Harry looks at Dudley's watch, which beeps 12:00.\n\n \n\nHarry: Make a wish, Harry. {Blows}\n\n \n\nSuddenly, the door thumps. Harry jumps. The door thumps again and Dudley and Harry jump up and back away. Petunia and Vernon appear, Vernon with a gun. The door bangs again and then cracks open, and a giant man appears.\n\n \n\nVernon: Who's there? Ahh!\n\nHagrid: Sorry 'bout that. {He puts the door back up}\n\nVernon: I demand that you leave at once, Sir! You are breaking and entering!\n\nPetunia: Ooh.\n\n \n\nHagrid comes over, grabs the gun and bends it upwards.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. {The gun fires}\n\nAll: Ahh!\n\nHagrid: {sees Dudley} Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harrybut you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!\n\nDudley: I-I-I'm not Harry.\n\nHarry appears: I-I am.\n\nHagrid: Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. {Hands Harry the cake} Words and all. Heh.\n\nHarry: Thank you! {Opens cake, which reads: Happee Birdae Harry.}\n\nHagrid: It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?\n\n \n\nHagrid sits down on the couch, takes out an umbrella and points it at the empty fire. Poof, poof! Two sparks fly out and the fire starts. The family gapes.\n\n \n\nHarry: {puts cake down} Excuse me, who are you?\n\nHagrid: Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.\n\nHarry: Sorry, no.\n\nHagrid: No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?\n\nHarry: Learnt what?\n\nHagrid: You're a wizard, Harry.\n\nHarry: I-I'm a what?\n\nHarry: A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.\n\nHarry: No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.\n\nHagrid: Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? {Harry softens his expression} Ah.\n\nDudley: {whimpers}\n\n \n\nHagrid hands Harry the same letter that has been sent the past while. Harry opens it.\n\n \n\nHarry: Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!\n\nVernon: Hell not be going! We swore when we took him in wed put an end to this rubbish!\n\nHarry: You knew?? You knew all along and you never told me?\n\nPetunia: Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you.\n\nHarry: Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!\n\nHagrid: A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?\n\nPetunia: We had to tell him something.\n\nHagrid: It's an outrage! It's a scandal!\n\nVernon: He'll not be going!\n\nHagrid: Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?\n\nHarry: Muggle?\n\nHagrid: Non magic folk. This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts' has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.\n\nVernon: I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!\n\nHagrid: {whips out umbrella and points it at Vernon} Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.\n\n \n\nHagrid sees Dudley eating Harry's cake, and points the umbrella at his rear. A grey tail grows.\n\n \n\nDudley: Ahh!\n\nAll: Ahh! {family chases Dudley}\n\nHarry: {laughs}\n\nHagrid: Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.\n\nHarry: {Nods} Okay.\n\nHagrid: {checks a clock} Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm? {Leaves}\n\n \n\nHarry grins, looks back, and grins again.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nStreets of London. Hagrid and Harry are walking.\n\nHarry: All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London?\n\nHagrid: If you know where to go.\n\n \n\nThey go to a corner store and enter, The Leaky Cauldron.\n\n{Music and talking}\n\n \n\nBarkeep Tom: Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?\n\nHagrid: No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.\n\nTom: Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.\n\n \n\nThe pub goes silent. A man comes up and shakes Harrys hand.\n\n \n\nMan: Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\n\n \n\nA witch comes up and shakes Harrys hand, as well.\n\n \n\nWitch: Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.\n\n \n\nA man in robes with a turban on his head appears. It is PROFESSOR QUIRRELL.\n\n \n\nQuirrell: Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.\n\nHagrid: Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.\n\nHarry: Oh, nice to meet you. {Puts out hand. Quirrell refuses}\n\nQuirrell: F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.\n\nHagrid: Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.\n\nHarry: Good-bye.\n\n \n\nThe two leave into a back room winery in front of a brick wall.\n\n \n\nHagrid: See, Harry, you're famous!\n\nHarry: But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?\n\nHagrid: I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. {Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street.}\n\nWelcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.  \n\n \n\nHarry grins broadly as they step into the street and walk down it. An owl screeches.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.\n\n \n\nHarry is amazed as they pass by shops and owls and bats. The camera pans on a broom store, where a group of boys are crowded around a shiny broom.\n\n \n\nBoy: It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, its the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet.\n\nHarry: But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.\n\nHagrid: Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.\n\n \n\nInside the bank, they walk down the shiny aisle, passing tiny creatures working.\n\n \n\nHarry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?\n\nHagrid: They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin in it.} Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.\n\n \n\nThe goblin looks up.\n\n \n\nGoblin: And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?\n\nHagrid: Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. {Hands Goblin letter wrapped in string.}\n\nGoblin: Very well.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nRacing down the depth caverns in a cartlike structure. The cart stops, a goblin, GRIPHOOK, clambers out.\n\n \n\nGriphook: Vault 687. Lamp, please. {Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault} Key please. {Hagrid hands him the key and he unlocks it}\n\n \n\nThe room is filled nearly top to bottom with coins. Harry is amazed.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing, now didja?\n\n \n\nThey continue on through the cavern.\n\n \n\nGriphook: Vault 713.\n\nHarry: What's in there, Hagrid?\n\nHagrid: Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.\n\nGriphook: Stand back. {Slides finger down the door. Clank. Clank. The vault opens to expose a small white stone package. Hagrid hurries in and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.}\n\n \n\nHagrid: Best not mention this to anyone, Harry.\n\nHarry nods.\n\n \n\nScene: Outside in the street, walking.\n\n \n\nHarry: I still need...a wand.\n\nHagrid: A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. No place better. Run along therebut wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.\n\n \n\nHarry goes into the store, quietly. He looks around. There are shelves of wandsbut no people.\n\n \n\nHarry: {Softly} Hello? Hello?\n\n \n\nThere is a thunk. A man appears on a ladder and looks at Harry. He smiles.\n\n \n\nOllivander: I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. {Picks a wand} Ah. Here we are. {Harry holds it but just stands} Well, give it a wave.\n\nHarry: Oh! {waves. All the shelves come crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.}\n\nOllivander: Apparently not. {Gets another wand.} Perhaps this. {Harry waves at a vase, which blows apart.} No, no, definitely not! No matter...{gets a wand} I wonder. {Hands wand to Harry. Harry glows under it.} Curious, very curious.\n\nHarry: Sorrybut what's curious?\n\nOllivander: I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. {Points to scar}\n\nHarry: And...who owned that wand?\n\nOllivander: Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear whybut I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yesbut great. {Hands Harry his wand.}\n\n \n\nThere is a knock on the window.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! {Has a snowy owl in a cage which hoots.}\n\nHarry: Wow.\n\n \n\nScene: Later, eating supper. The two, Hagrid and Harry, are at a long table, eating soup.\n\n \n\nHagrid: You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.\n\nHarry: He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.\n\nHagrid: {Sighs and pushes bowl away} First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...\n\nHarry: Maybe if you wrote it down?\n\nHagrid: No, I can't spell it. All right. His name was Voldemort.\n\nHarry: Voldemort?\n\nHagrid: Shh!!\n\n{Harry looks around}\n\n \n\nA flashback ensues, consisting off a cloaked man walking towards a house, breaking in with his wand, and proceeding to terrorize. Hagrid narrates.\n\n \n\nHagrid: It was dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against himbut nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. {Harrys mother, LILY, screams as she is killed by Voldemorts wand} Nobody...not one. Except you. {close-up of baby Harry.}\n\nHarry: Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?\n\nHagrid: Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.\n\nHarry: What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?\n\nHagrid: Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, Harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.\n\n \n\n\n  \nScene: London Train Station. Up on a crossing bridge, Harry (with cart and owl) walk beside Hagrid.\n\n \n\nA couple look at Hagrid.\n\n \n\nHagrid: What're you looking at? {Looks at watch} Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.\n\n \n\nHarry looks at his golden ticket.\n\n \n\nHarry: Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there? {Harry looks up and Hagrid has vanished.}\n\n \n\nScene: Harry is walking down lane between trains. A man rushes by.\n\n \n\nMan: Sorry.\n\nHarry sees a train master.\n\nHarry: Excuse me, excuse me.\n\nTrainmaster: {talking to woman and child} Right on your left, ma'am.\n\nHarry: Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?\n\nTrainmaster: 9 ¾? Think youre being funny, do ya? {Leaves}\n\n \n\nA woman, daughter, and four boys walk by, pushing carts.\n\n \n\nMrs. Weasley: It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.\n\nHarry: Muggles?\n\nMrs. Weasley: Come on. Platform 9 ¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.\n\n \n\nA tall boy with red hair comes forward and runs towards a brick wall. Amazingly, he disappears right into it. Harry is amazed.\n\n \n\nMrs. Weasley: Fred, you next.\n\nGeorge: He's not Fred, I am!\n\nFred: Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother!\n\nMrs. Weasley: Oh, I'm sorry, George.\n\nFred: I'm only joking. I am Fred. {He runs through the wall, and is followed by his twin brother.}\n\n \n\nHarry shakes his head in disbelief.\n\n \n\nHarry: Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to\n\nMrs. Weasley: How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. {pan to a red haired boy who smiles} Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous.\n\nGinny (daughter): Good luck.\n\n \n\nHarry takes a breath and runs at the wall. He shuts his eyes and emerges on the other side a magnificent station with a red train and bundles of people. A whistle blows, and Harry sighs with relief.\n\n \n\nScene: The train is traveling through unknown country. Pan to inside compartment, where Harry is sitting. The red headed boy, RON, appears, dirt on his nose.\n\n \n\nRon: Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.\n\nHarry: No, not at all.\n\nRon: {sits across from Harry} I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.\n\nHarry: I'm Harry. Harry Potter.\n\n{Ron goes agape.}\n\nRon: So-so it's true?! I mean, do you really have the...the...\n\nHarry: The what?\n\nRon: {whispers} Scar...?\n\nHarry: Oh, yeah. {lifts up hair}\n\nRon: Wicked.\n\nA trolley comes by the compartment, full of sweets.\n\nWoman: Anything off the trolley, dears?\n\nRon: {Holds up mushed sandwiches} No, thanks, I'm all set. {smacks lips.}\n\nHarry: {pulls out coins} We'll take the lot!\n\nRon: Whoa!\n\n \n\nScene: Eating bundles of sweets.\n\nRon's rat, Scabbers, is perched on Ron's knee, a box over its head.\n\n \n\nHarry: Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?\n\nRon: They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!\n\n \n\nHarry quickly takes the bean he was chewing out of his mouth.\n\n \n\nHarry: {picks up blue and gold package} These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?\n\nRon: It's only a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.\n\nFrog: Ribbit. {The frog jumps onto the window and climbs up, then leaps out the window...disappearing.}\n\nRon: Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.\n\nHarry: Hey, I got Dumbledore!\n\nRon: I got about 6 of him.\n\nHarry: Hey, he's gone!\n\nRon: Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?\n\nHarry: Just a little bit.\n\nRon: Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?\n\nHarry: Yeah!\n\nRon: {clears throat} Ahem. Sun-\n\n \n\nA girl, HERMIONE GRANGER, with bushy brown hair appears at the doorway.\n\n \n\nHermione: Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.\n\nRon: No.\n\nHermione: Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.\n\nRon: Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daisesbutter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!\n\n{Zap. Nothing happens. Ron shrugs.}\n\nHermione: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?\n\nRon: {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.\n\nHermione: Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. {Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}\n\n \n\nScene: Darkness, the train blows its whistle and pulls into an outdoor station. Hagrid walks along the side aisle, with a lantern. People begin pouring out of the train.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!\n\n \n\nHarry and Ron walk up to Hagrid.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Hello, Harry.\n\nHarry: Hey, Hagrid.\n\nRon: Whoaa!\n\nHagrid: Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nA number of boats are plugging across a vast lake, where up ahead a huge castle can be seen. People are in awe.\n\nRon: Wicked.\n\n \n\nScene: On a higher level, Professor McGonagall is waiting. She raps her fingers on a stone railing, and then goes to the top of the stairs to greet the newcomers.\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Now, while you are here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup\n\n \n\nNEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, a scared looking boy, spots his toad sitting near McGonagall. He jumps forward.\n\n \n\nNeville: Trevor! {McGonagall stares down at him} Sorry. {He backs away.}\n\nMcGonagall: The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. {leaves}\n\n \n\nDRACO MALFOY, a slicked back evil looking boy speaks up.\n\n \n\nDraco: It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. {Students whisper, Harry Potter?} This is Crabbe, and Goyle {nods to thugs} and I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. {Ron snickers at his name} Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand me down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. {extends hand.}\n\nHarry: I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.\n\n \n\nDraco glares. McGonagall returns and smacks him on the shoulder with a paper. He retreats with one last glare.\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: We're ready for you now.\n\n \n\nShe leads everyone through two large doors and into the Great Hall, where there are four long tables with many kids, as well as floating candles. The roof appears to be the sky.\n\n \n\nHermione: It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.\n\nMcGonagall: All right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbldedore would like to say a few words.\n\n \n\nDumbledore rises from the main table.\n\n \n\nDumbledore: I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.\n\nMcGonagall: When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.\n\nHermione: Oh, no. Okay, relax. {She goes up}\n\nRon: Mental that one, I'm telling you.\n\nHarry nods in agreement.\n\nSorting Hat: Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!\n\n(Cheering)\n\n \n\nHermione jumps off with a smile.\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: Draco Malfoy.\n\n \n\nDraco saunters up proudly. The tattered hat nearly freaks before touching down on Dracos head.\n\n \n\nSorting Hat: SLYTHERIN!\n\n \n\nRon: There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.\n\nMcGonagall: Susan Bones.\n\n \n\nA small, redhead goes up.\n\nHarry looks around and spots a black haired, pale teacher, SEVERUS SNAPE, looking at him. His scar hurts.\n\n \n\nHarry: Ahh! {puts hand on forehead}\n\nRon: Harry, what is it?\n\nHarry: Nothing...it's nothing, I'm fine.\n\n \n\nSorting Hat: Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!\n\nMcGonagall: Ronald Weasley.\n\n \n\nRon gulps and walks up. He sits down and the hat is put on.\n\n \n\nSorting Hat: Ah! Another Weasley. I know just where to put you...Gryffindor!!\n\nRon: {Sighs}\n\n(Cheering)\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: Harry Potter.\n\n \n\nEverything goes silent. Harry walks up and sits down.\n\n \n\nSorting Hat: Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?\n\nHarry: {whispers} Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.\n\nSorting Hat: Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. Its all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on your way to greatness! There's no doubt about that! No? {Harry whispers: Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin} Well, if youre sure...better be...GRYFFINDOR!!\n\n \n\nThere is an immense cheering and Harry goes to the Gryffindor table.\n\nFred and George are also there, and cheer: We got Potter! We got Potter! Harry sits down.\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: {dings on a cup} Your attention, please.\n\nDumbledore: Let the feast...begin.\n\n \n\nFood magically appears on all the tables, and the hall is filled with awe and chatter.\n\n \n\nHarry: Wow.\n\n \n\nDraco looks at all the food, raises his eyebrows and digs in.\n\nRon stuffs his face.\n\n \n\nSEAMUS FINNIGAN, a tiny boy, speaks.\n\n \n\nSeamus: I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.\n\nNeville laughs.\n\n \n\nHarry is sitting next to Percy. He leans over.\n\n \n\nHarry: Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\n\nPercy: Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.\n\nHarry: What's he teach?\n\nPercy: Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrells job for years.\n\n \n\nRon, having just finished a chicken wing, reaches into the bowl for more, and a ghostly head, SIR NICHOLAS, pops out.\n\n \n\nRon: Ahh!\n\nNick: Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.\n\n \n\nNumerous ghosts come pouring from the walls, sailing along.\n\n \n\nHufflepuff ghost: Whoo-hoo-hoo!\n\nGirl: Look, its the Bloody Baron!\n\nPercy: Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?\n\nNick: Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. {Begins to leave}\n\nRon: Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!\n\nNick: I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.\n\nHermione: Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?\n\nNick: Like this. {Grabs head and pulls it to the side. His head is hanging on just by a thread.}\n\nRon: Ahh!\n\nHermione: Eugh.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nPercy is leading the Gryffindors to the staircases.\n\n \n\nPercy: Gryffindors, follow me please. Keep up. Thank you.\n\nBoy: Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.\n\nPercy: This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change.\n\n \n\nThe camera pans up and we see a vast amount of staircases, people walking on them, and some switching places.\n\n \n\nPercy: Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. {They begin walking up the stairs}\n\nNeville: Seamus, that picture's moving!\n\nRon: Look at that one, Harry!\n\nHarry: I think she fancies you.\n\nGirl: Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?\n\nMan in painting: Welcome to Hogwarts.\n\nGirl: Who's that?\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nApproaching the Gryffindor dorms. They come up to a large painting of a large woman in a pink dress.\n\n \n\nWoman: Password?\nPercy: Caput Draconis. {The woman nods and the painting opens to reveal a gape in the wall.} Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on.\n\nGirl: Oh, wow.\n\nPercy: {Inside common room} Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boys' dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.\n\n \n\nScene: Mid-night. Harry is sitting by a window in his pj's, with his owl, Hedwig. He pets the owl and looks out the window, sighing with content.\n\n \n\n\n \nScene: Morning. Harry and Ron are running through the stone halls to their class. They rush in. In the class, a tabby cat is sitting on a desk.\n\n \n\nRon: Whew, amazing, can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?\n\n \n\nThe cat jumps off the desk and turns into Professor McGonagall. The two boys are amazed.\n\n \n\nRon: That was bloody brilliant.\n\nMcGonagall: Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, maybe one of you would be on time.\n\nHarry: We got lost.\n\nMcGonagall: Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.\n\n \n\nScene: Snape's potions class. The students are chattering, sitting near steaming cauldrons. The door slams open and Snape comes rushing in.\n\n \n\nSnape: There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few {looks at Draco, who smiles}, who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper {Draco looks on} in death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his view, not paying attention.} Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.\n\n \n\nHermione nudges Harry in the ribs. He looks up.\n\n \n\nSnape: Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? {Hermione's hand skyrockets. Harry shrugs.} You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? {Hermione's hand shoots up again.}\n\nHarry: I don't know, Sir.\n\nSnape: And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?\n\nHarry: I don't know, Sir.\n\nSnape: Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?\n\n \n\nScene: In the great hall, probably midday. The students are all working on homework.\n\n \n\nSeamus is trying a spell on a cup.\n\n \n\nSeamus: Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. {Looks in cup and shakes head.} Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...\n\nHarry: What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?\n\nRon: Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...\n\n \n\nZAPOOF! The cup explodes. There is laughter amongst the students. Suddenly, a flock of owls start coming into the hall from the rafters above.\n\n \n\nRon: Ah. Mail's here!\n\n \n\nThe owls soar by, dropping parcels to students. Harry gets nothing. He sees the newspaper Ron has put down.\n\n \n\nHarry: Can I borrow this? {Ron nods} Thanks.\n\n \n\nNeville is unwrapping a gift. It is a clear ball with gold around it.\n\n \n\nSeamus: Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!\n\nHermione: I've read about those. When the smoke turns red {the smoke turns red}, it means you've forgotten something.\n\nNeville: The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.\n\nHarry: Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.\n\n \n\nScene: Outside, flying practice. The students, Gryffindor and Slytherin, are lined up in two rows with brooms by their sides. The teacher, MADAM HOOCH, comes down the line. She has short hair and hawk yellow eyes.\n\n \n\nHooch: Good afternoon, class.\n\nClass: Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.\n\nHooch: Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. {to class} Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, Up!\n\nClass: Up!\n\n \n\nHarry's broom flies into his hand.\n\n \n\nHarry: Whoa. {Hermione stares as the class continues.}\n\nDraco: Up! {broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.}\n\nHooch: With feeling!\n\nHermione: Up. Up. Up. Up.\n\nRon: Up!! {His broom flies up and conks him on the nose} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}\n\nHooch: Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. {Class mounts} When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...{tweet!}\n\n \n\nNeville immediately lifts off. He looks quite frightened.\n\n \n\nNeville: Oh...\n\nHooch: Mr. Longbottom.\n\nGirl: Neville, what are you doing?\n\nStudents: Neville...Neville...\n\nBoy: We're not supposed to take off, yet.\n\nHooch: {Neville begins soaring away} M-M-Mr. Longbottom Mr. Longbottom!\n\nNeville: AHH!\nHooch: Mr. Longbottom!\n\nNeville: {soars away} Down! Down! Ahhhh!\n\nHarry: Neville! {shouting}\n\nNeville: Help!!!\n\nHooch: Come back down this instant!\n\nNeville: AHH!\n\n \n\nHe soars through the sky and hits a wall, conking along it and then swooping off. All the while, he is screaming. He begins to zoom back towards the group of students. Hooch holds out her wand to stop him.\n\n \n\nNeville: Help!\n\nHooch: Mr. Longbottom! {Neville approaches. The students scatter and Hooch dives out of the way. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.}\n\nNeville: Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! {zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.} Oh. Ah...help! {He wavers, then the cloak rips, and he falls, catching on a torchbut then slipping out and falling to the ground.} Ahh!\n\nHooch: Everyone out of the way! {She runs through the group, and they scatter.} Come on, get up.\n\nGirl: Is he alright?\n\nNeville: Owowowow.\n\nHooch: Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get. {Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.} Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. {Exit.}\n\nDraco: {snickers} Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat ass. {Laughs.}\n\nHarry: Give it here, Malfoy.\n\nDraco: No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. {hops on broom and soars around group, then through.} How 'bout up on the roof?? {soars off and hovers high in the sky.} What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?\n\n \n\nHarry grabs his broom and runs to get on it. Hermione stops him.\n\n \n\nHermione: Harry, no! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. {Harry flies off.} What an idiot.\n\n \n\nHarry is now in the air, across from Draco.\n\n \n\nHarry: Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!\n\nDraco: Is that so? {Harry makes a dash for himbut Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.} Have it your way, then! {He throws the Remembrall into the air.}\n\n \n\nHarry zooms after the ball, speeding towards a tower. Just as he is about to hit a window, from which McGonagall is working/watching, he catches it, and then heads back to the group. The students all cheer and run to see him.\n\n \n\nBoy: Good job, Harry!\n\nBoy 2: Oh, that was wicked, Harry.\n\nMcGonagall: {appears quickly} Harry Potter? Follow me. {Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons laugh.}\n\n \n\nScene: Professor Quirrells classroom. He is inside, teaching, holding an iguana.\n\n \n\nQuirrell: An iguana s-such as this is {McGonagall approaches the class and stops Harry: You wait here.} an essential in-gredient\n\nMcGonagall: Excuse me, excuse me, Professor Quirrell. Could I borrow Wood for a moment?\n\nQuirrell: Oh. Y-yes, of course. {a boy, OLIVER WOOD, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.} And the vampire b-bat...{eerie roar.}\n\nMcGonagall: Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!\n\n \n\nScene: Harry and Ron are walking through crowded halls. Sir Nicholas and a lady ghost float by.\n\n \n\nNick: Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew hed do well.\n\nRon: Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in\n\nHarry: A century, according to McGonagall.\n\n \n\nFred and George approach and walk along with Ron and Harry.\n\n \n\nFred: Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!\n\nRon: Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.\n\nGeorge: Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.\n\nFred: Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally... {They break off from Harry and Ron, who walk across a courtyard.  \n\nGeorge: But they'll turn up in a month or two!!\n\nRon: Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! {Hermione jumps up from her work and comes to join them.}\n\nHarry: But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?\n\nHermione: You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.\n\n \n\nScene: The three approach a trophy case. Hermione points at a plaque of Quidditch players. One lists Harry's father as a Seeker.\n\n \n\nRon: Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.\n\nHarry: I-I didn't know.\n\n \n\n\n \nScene: The three are walking up a staircase. A railing pulls in...Hermione looksbut continues walking.\n\n \n\nRon: I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.\n\nHarry: Who doesn't?\n\n \n\nThe staircase shudders and begins to move. The three grab the railings.\n\n \n\nRon: Ahh!\n\nHermione: {Gasps.}\n\nHarry: What's happening?\n\nHermione: The staircases change, remember? {The staircase stops, in a new place.}\n\nHarry: {taps Ron} Let's go this way.\n\nRon: Before the staircase moves again. {They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark room.}\n\nHarry: Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?\n\nHermione: We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.\n\n \n\nSuddenly, a flame lights on a tall stone support. At that moment, the caretaker's cat, MRS. NORRIS, comes running in and meows. The group jumps.\n\n \n\nHarry: Let's go.\n\n{meow}\n\nRon: It's Filch's cat!\n\nHarry: Run!\n\n \n\nThe group runs. Flames are lit as they go. They get to the end of the corridor, to a door. Harry grabs the handlebut it's locked.\n\n \n\nHarry: It's locked!\n\nRon: That's it, we're done for!\n\nHermione: Oh, move over! {pushes through and pulls out wand} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Get in. {They bustle in.}\n\nRon: Alohomora?\n\nHermione: Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.\n\n \n\nFilch appears at the start of the corridor with a light. Mrs. Norris looks at him.\n\n \n\nFilch: Anyone here, my sweet? {meow} Come on. {exit.}\n\nHermione: Filch is gone.\n\nRon: Probably thinks this door's locked.\n\nHermione: It was locked.\n\nHarry: And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}\n\nAll: AHHHHHHH! {The three bolt, running out of the door. They turn quickly to shut the door and battle against the dog. They get the door shut and run.}\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nBack in the Gryffindor room. They are breathless.\n\n \n\nRon: What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.\n\nHermione: You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?\n\nRon: I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}\n\nHermione: It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.\n\nHarry: Guarding something?\n\nHermione: That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}\n\nRon: She needs to sort out her priorities!\n\nHarry nods.\n\n \n\nScene: Outside, day time. Oliver and Harry appear, carrying a trunk. They put it down.\n\n \n\nOliver: Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. There are three kinds of balls. {picks up a red one} This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. {Points to a faraway Quidditch pitch.} The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. {throws ball to Harry.} With me so far?\n\nHarry: {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.}\n\nOliver: ...You better take this. {hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.} Careful now, it's comin' back. {The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue.} Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. {The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.} Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But the only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. {hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.}\n\nHarry: I like this ball.\n\nOliver: Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.\n\nHarry: What do I do with it?\n\nOliver: You catch it...before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.\n\n{The ball flutters out two delicate wings and jumps into the air. Harry keeps an eye on it.}\n\nHarry: Whoa.\n\n \n\nScene: PROFESSOR FLITWICK's class. The teacher is very short, and is standing on a bunch of books.\n\n \n\nFlitwick: One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers? {Hermione raises hers.} Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone. {All} The swish and flick. Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.\n\nDraco: Wingardium Levio-saaa.\n\n{All practice.}\n\nRon: Wingardrium Leviosar. {whacks with wand numerous times.}\n\nHermione: Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.\n\nRon: You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.\n\n \n\nHermione straightens up and swishes her wand.\n\n \n\nHermione: {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.}\n\nFlitwick: Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!\n\n \n\nSeamus begins swishing at his feather.\n\n \n\nSeamus: Wingard Levosa. Wingard Levosa. {Flitwick to Hermione: Well done, dear.}\n\n \n\nBOOOM!!! Seamus' feather explodes. Flitwick gasps.\n\n \n\nFlitwick: Whooaaa! Ooh.\n\nHarry: I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.\n\n \n\nScene: Neville, Harry, Ron and Seamus are walking through a courtyard with other students all around.\n\n \n\nRon: It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!\n\n \n\nHermione bustles past, sniffling.\n\n \n\nHarry: I think she heard you.\n\n \n\nScene: Night, in the great hall. It is Halloween. Everyone is eating candy, and Jack O'Lanterns are keeping the place lit. There is chatter.\n\n \n\nHarry: Where's Hermione?\n\nNeville: Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.\n\n{Ron and Harry exchange glances. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell comes flying into the room, screaming.}\n\nQuirrell: TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! {stops and there is utter silence.} Thought you ought to know. {falls over in a dead faint.}\n\n \n\nThe room is silent, and then everyone freaks, screaming and running.\n\n \n\nDumbledore: SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.\n\nGirl: Hufflepuff, this way!\n\nBoy: Stay together!\n\n \n\nSnape looks aghast, and he disappears through a doorway.\n\n \n\nScene: Percy is leading the house down a hall.\n\n \n\nPercy: Gryffindors...keep up please. And stay alert!\n\nHarry: How could a troll get in?\n\nRon: Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?\n\nHarry: Hermione! She doesn't know!\n\n \n\nThe two run off, down corridors. They start running down a hall when they stop, because there is a grunting noise. Harry pulls Ron into a doorway and a large, ugly TROLL thunks by into a room.\n\n \n\nHarry: He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!\n\n \n\nScene: In the bathroom, Hermione emerges from a stall, wiping her eyes. She stops when she sees something. The troll is standing there. Hermione backs up, into the stall just as the troll raises its club and smashes the top part of the stalls. Hermione screams. Harry and Ron come bursting in.\n\n \n\nHarry: Hermione, move!\n\n \n\nThe troll smashes the remaining stalls.\n\n \n\nHermione: Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.}\n\nRon: Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sinkbut the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}\n\nHermione: Ahhh! Help!\n\n \n\nHarry gets out his wand. He runs forward and grabs the troll's club, and is lifted up.\n\n \n\nHarry: Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}\n\nRon: Ew.\n\n \n\nThe troll snorts, and whips around.\n\n \n\nHarry: Whoa, whoa whoa!\n\n \n\nThe troll gets Harry off its head and is holding him by one leg, upside down. It gears up its club and swipes at Harry. He pulls himself up, then down. The troll swipes again.\n\n \n\nHarry: Do something! {swipe}\n\nRon: What? {swipe}\n\nHarry: Anything! Hurry up!\n\n \n\nRon grabs his wand. Under the sink, Hermione waves her hand.\n\n \n\nHermione: Swish and flick!\n\nRon: Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. (Ron: Cool.)  It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard.\n\n \n\nHermione approaches carefully.\n\n \n\nHermione: Is it...dead?\n\nHarry: I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.\n\n \n\nSuddenly, McGonagall, Snape and Quirrell come rushing in.\n\nThey all gasp.\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!\n\nRon and Harry: Well, what it is...\n\nHermione: It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}\n\nMcGonagall: Ms. Granger?\n\nHermione: I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.\n\nMcGonagall: Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. {Harry looks at Snape's leg...which has a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.} I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part, Ms. Granger. 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points...will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck. {Snape and McGonagall exit.}\n\nQuirrell: Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. {Exit Ron and Harry and Hermione.} {Troll roars.} Ahh! Hehe....\n\n \n\nScene: The next morning, in the great hall. The gang is sitting, eating. Harry is twirling his food on a fork.\n\n \n\nRon: Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.\n\nHermione: Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.\n\nHarry: I'm not hungry.\n\n \n\nSnape appears.\n\n \n\nSnape: Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}\n\nHarry: That explains the blood.\n\nHermione: Blood?\n\nHarry: Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.\n\nHermione: But why would anyone go near that dog?\n\nHarry: The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.\n\nHermione: So you're saying...\n\nHarry: That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.\n\n{An owl screeches. It is Hedwig. She is carrying a very large, long parcel. She drops it off.}\n\nHermione: Bit early for mail, isn't it?\n\nHarry: But I-I never get mail.\n\nRon: Let's open it.\n\n{They open it.}\n\nHarry: It's a broomstick!\nRon: Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!\n\nHarry: But who...?\n\n{He sees Professor McGonagall up at the head table, stroking Hedwig. She smiles and Harry nods.}\n\n \n\nScene: Inside a Quidditch tower. The Gryffindor team is marching towards the starting gate. They reach it and stop, behind a closed double door.\n\n \n\nOIiver: Scared, Harry?\n\nHarry: A little bit.\n\nOliver: That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.\n\nHarry: What happened?\nOliver: Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.\n\n \n\nHarry gulps and looks straight ahead as the doors open. They mount their brooms and zoom out onto the enormous pitch. There is cheering. The commentator, LEE JORDAN, is talking from a tower.\n\n \n\nLee: Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!\n\n \n\n{Cheering. Close-up of Gryffindor students. They are cheering. Neville: Gryffindor!}\n\n \n\nThe players take their positions in the air in a circle. Harry weaves in, highest amongst. He looks down.\n\n \n\nLee: The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.\n\nHooch: Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. {looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the bludgers zoom out.}\n\nLee: The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.\n\n \n\nThe snitch zooms around each Seeker's head, then disappears. Hooch grabs the Quaffle.\n\n \n\nLee: The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!\n\n \n\nGryffindor takes possession of the ball and a chaser, ANGELINA JOHNSON, zooms past Slytherins towards their goal, and throws the ball, and scores! There is a ding.\n\n \n\nLee: Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! {He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindors name.}\n\n \n\nHarry, in the air, claps.\n\n \n\nHarry: Yes! {a bludger zooms by him.} Whoa!\n\n \n\nIn the stands, Gryffindor cheers.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Well done!\n\nLee: Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.\n\n \n\nFlint dodges people and throws for the Gryffindor hoops. Oliver appears and whacks the ball away with his broom. He smirks at Flint, who glares. Johnson and KATIE BELL pass the Quaffle back and forth as they strategize to score. Johnson takes it, throws, and once again scores!\n\n \n\nRon and Seamus: Yay!\n\nHarry: Yes!\n\nLee: Another 10 points to Gryffindor! {ding.}\n\nGryffindors: Yay!\n\n \n\nThe Slytherins decide to get messy. They dodge, kick, and try to score. Once again, Oliver blocks.\n\n \n\nFlint: Give me that! {he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver in the stomach and he falls to the ground.}\n\n \n\nCrowd: {Booing}\n\nHarry is visibly upset.\n\nSlytherin laughs.\n\n \n\nThe Slytherin members head off. One jumps over George (or Fred) and scores. Harry is upset again. Slytherin cheers.\n\n \n\nFlint: {to other members} Take that side!\n\n \n\nThey box Johnson in and sent her into the capes covering one of the towers. She falls down in and is out. The crowd boos. Slytherin scores once again. Suddenly, Harry sees the Snitch. He starts to head off after it and then his broom starts bucking and turning.\n\n \n\nHarry: Whoa! Whooa!\n\nHagrid: What's going on with Harry's broomstick?\n\n \n\nHermione looks through binoculars at Harry, then at Snape, who is muttering something.\n\n \n\nHermione: It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!\n\nRon: Jinxing the broom? What do we do?\n\nHermione: Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.}\n\n \n\nHarry is knocked around, then falls, dangling by one arm from the broom.\n\n \n\nRon: Come on, Hermione!\n\n \n\nHermione is hurrying up a tower. She appears underneath Snape and touches his cloak with her wand.\n\n \n\nHermione: Lacarnum Inflamarae.\n\n \n\nA spark ignites and Snape's cloak catches fire. Hermione leaves.\n\n \n\nMan: Fire! You're on fire!\n\nSnape: What? Oh! {knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.}\n\n \n\nRon: Go!\n\nHagrid: Go go go!\n\n \n\nHarry rams the Slytherin Seeker, then is butted out. He returns, smashing the Seeker again as the Snitch dives. The boys followbut they approach the ground quickly. The Slytherin Seeker backs out, and Harry pulls up his broom as he follows the Snitch, feet above the ground. Harry stands up, and steps forward, trying to grab the ball. He goes too far, and topples off the broom with a yelp, tumbling on the ground. He gets up and lurches.\n\n \n\nThe crowd gasps. Hermione appears beside a tower to see.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Looks like he's gonna be sick!\n\n \n\nHarry lurches and the Snitch pops out of his mouth. It lands in his hands.\n\n \n\nLee: He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!\n\nHooch: {Blows whistle} Gryffindor win!\n\nAll: YAY!\n\nDraco: No!\n\nHagrid: Yes!\n\nHermione: Whoo-hoo!\n\nMcGonagall: {Giggles happily}\n\n \n\nHarry raises the Snitch into the air and the crowd, and his team, cheers.\n\n \n\nCrowd: Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!\n\n \n\n\n \n\nScene:\nHarry, Hermione and Ron are walking along a path with Hagrid, talking.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?\n\nHarry: Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?\n\nHagrid: Who told you 'bout Fluffy?\n\nRon: Fluffy?\nHermione: That thing has a name?\n\nHagrid: Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the\n\nHarry: Yes?\n\nHagrid: Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.\n\nHarry: But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!\n\nHagrid: Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.\n\nHermione: Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking.\n\nHarry: Exactly.\n\nHagrid: {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.\n\nHarry: Nicholas Flamel?\n\nHagrid: I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.}\n\nHarry: Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?\n\nHermione: I don't know.\n\n \n\nScene: Christmas. The camera pans up to a snowy castle, then to Hagrid, who is bringing in a large tree. Inside the great hall, students are leaving and ghosts are singing (Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, ring the Hogwarts bell. Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas...) Hermione approaches the empty tables, wheeling a cart. She goes to Ron and Harry, who are playing chess.\n\n \n\nHarry: Knight to E-5.\n\n \n\nA piece moves across the board.\n\n \n\nRon thinks for a moment.\n\n \n\nRon: Queen to E-5.\n\n \n\nA queen walks over to E-5 and clinks the knight away.\n\n \n\nHermione: That's totally barbaric!\n\nRon: That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.\n\nHermione: See you haven't.\n\nRon: Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!\n\nHermione: Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.\n\nRon: We've looked a hundred times!\n\nHermione: Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. {exits.}\n\nRon: I think we've had a bad influence on her.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nX-mas morning. Hedwig is perched in the boys' room, and Harry is asleep in bed.\n\n \n\nRon: {calling from downstairs} Harry, wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!\n\n \n\nHarry gets up and runs to a balcony overlooking the common room, where Ron is standing next to a tree. He is wearing a sweater with an R on it.\n\n \n\nRon: Happy Christmas, Harry.\n\nHarry: Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?\n\nRon: Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!\n\nHarry: I've got presents?\n\nRon: Yeah!\n\nHarry: Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.}\n\nRon: There they are. {Ron sits on a couch arm and eats jelly beans as Harry picks up a silver wrapped package. Harry takes out the card.}\n\nHarry: \""Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.\""\n\n \n\nHarry opens the present. It is a cloak.\n\n \n\nRon: What is it?\n\nHarry: Some kind of...cloak.\n\nRon: Well, let's see then. Put it on.\n\n \n\nHarry puts the cloak on, and all of him disappears except for his head.\n\n \n\nRon: Whoa!\n\nHarry: My body's gone!\n\nRon: I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!\n\nHarry: I'm invisible??\n\nRon: {gets up} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.\n\nHarry: {comes over} There was no name. It just said, \""Use it well.\""\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nLate at night. A lantern and hand appearbut nothing else. The ensemble walk through the dark library and into the Restricted Section. The lamp is put down, and the cloak removed. Harry appears.\n\n \n\nHarry: {Reading books} Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?\n\n \n\nHarry picks up a book and opens it. A man's face appears.\n\n \n\nMan: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\n \n\nHarry slams the book shuts and puts it back.\n\n \n\nFilchs voice: Who's there?! {Harry whips around, grabbing his cloak. The lamp falls and shatters.} I know you're in there. You can't hide. {Harry puts on his cloak and creeps around Filch.} Who is it? Show yourself!\n\n \n\nHarry runs from the room, breathing heavily. He gets into the hall, where Mrs. Norris is. The cat meows and begins to follow him. Harry runs around a corner, just as Snape and Quirrell appear. Snape pushes Quirrell into the wall.\n\n \n\nQuirrell: Severus...I-I thought...\n\nSnape: You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.\n\nQuirrell: W-what do you m-mean?\n\nSnape: You know perfectly well what I mean. {Snape senses something. Harry stops breathing. Snape reaches out to grab somethingbut doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.} We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.\n\n \n\nFilch appears, carrying the broken lamp.\n\n \n\nFilch: Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.\n\n \n\nThey all dart off. A door opens, and closes. On the other side, there is a vast, empty room that has a large mirror in the center. Harry appears and walks over to the mirror. In it, he sees two people appear.\n\n \n\nHarry: Mum? {the woman nods and smiles} Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch thembut only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nThe boys' room. Harry comes whipping in, invisible.\n\n \n\nHarry: Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! {pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.} Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!\n\nRon: Why?\n\nHarry: There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nBack in the mirror room. Harry and Ron appear as if magically and Harry runs to the mirror.\n\n \n\nHarry: Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!\n\nRon: I only see me.\n\nHarry: {moves over} Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad\n\nRon: That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?\n\nHarry: How can it? Both my parents are dead. {Harry smiles sadly.}\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nAnother night. Harry is sitting in front of the mirror. Dumbledore appears behind him.\n\n \n\nDumbledore: Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.\n\nHarry: So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?\n\nDumbledore: Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nDaytime. It is all snowy. Harry is out in a main courtyard, bundled up, with Hedwig on his arm. He stops and she lifts off, soaring away into the sky. When she returns, it is spring time.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nIn the library. Harry and Ron are seated, reading. Hermione comes up with a huge book. She thumps it onto the table. Harry jumps.\n\n \n\nHermione: I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\n\nRon: This is light?\n\nHermione: {glares} Of course! Here it is! \""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!\""\n\nRon and Harry: The what?\n\nHermione: Honestly, don't you two read? \""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\""\n\nRon: Immortal?\n\nHermione: It means you'll never die.\n\nRon: I know what it means!\n\nHarry: Shh!\n\nHermione: \""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!\"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!\n\n \n\nThey all look at each other.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nNighttime. Hermione, Ron and Harry are running across the wet ground to Hagrids hut. They knock on the door and it opens.\n\n \n\nHarry: Hagrid!\n\nHagrid: {clad in oven mitts and an apron} Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rudebut I'm in no fit state to entertain today. {Closes door.}\n\nAll 3: We know about the Philosopher's Stone!\n\n{Door reopens.}\n\nHagrid: Oh.\n\n{They all come into Hagrid's small hut.}\n\nHarry: We think Snape's trying to steal it.\n\nHagrid: Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?\n\nHarry: Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.\n\nHagrid: Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!\n\nHarry: What?\n\nHagrid: You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.\n\nHarry: Wait a minute. {Ron and a big black boarhound, FANG, meet. Fang sniffs Ron.} One of the teachers?\nHermione: {sitting in a large chair} Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.\n\nHagrid: That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.\n\n{Hermione looks at Ron, who is being sniffed in the face by Fang. Ron shuffles away.} Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that. {A cauldron over a fire begins to rattle.} Oh! {Hagrid hurries over and grabs something} Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! {puts the thing, an egg, on the table. The group crowds around.}\n\nHarry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?\n\nHagrid: That? It's a ... its um...\n\nRon: I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?\n\nHagrid: I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.\n\n \n\nThe egg rattles and cracks. Pieces fly off as a dragon emerges. It squeaks and slips on an egg piece.\n\n \n\nHermione: Is that...a dragon?\n\nRon: That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.\n\nHagrid: Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}\n\nHarry: Norbert?\n\nHagrid: Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?\n\nRon: {laughs}\n\nHagrid: Don't you, Norbert? {raises fingers back and forth across Norberts chin} Dededede.\n\n \n\nNorbert backs away, hiccups and blows a fireball of fire into Hagrid's beard.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}\n\nHarry: Malfoy.\n\nHagrid: Oh, dear.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nThe three are walking back through a corridor. An owl screeches.\n\n \n\nHarry: Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.\n\nRon: It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.\n\nHarry: I don't understand. Is that bad?\n\nRon: It's bad.\n\n \n\nThey stop as McGonagall, in her nightgown, appears.\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: Good evening.\n\n \n\nMalfoy appears smugly beside her.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nMcGonagall's classroom. The three accused are standing in front of McGonagall's desk, while Malfoy is feet away, smirking.\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.\n\nHarry: 50?!\n\nMcGonagall: Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.\n\n \n\nMalfoy nods, then his smile vanishes.\n\n \n\nDraco: Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...\""the four of us.\""\n\n \n\nMcGonagall: No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.\n\n \n\nHarry, Ron and Hermione grin, and Draco sags.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nOutside, at night, the four students are being led to Hagrid's hut by Mr. Filch.\n\n \n\nFilch: A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. {Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.} You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. {Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.} A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?\n\n \n\nHagrid: {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.\n\nHermione: Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.\n\nHagrid: Yeahbut what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.\n\nFilch: Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.\n\nDraco: The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...{a howl sounds}...werewolves!\n\nFilch: There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. {Draco looks frightened.} Nighty-night. {Exit.}\n\nHagrid: Right. Let's go.\n\n \n\nScene: In the forest. The group walks along a path to a tree. Hagrid stops, bends down and dips his fingers in a silver puddle. He pulls out his fingers and rubs them together. A silver trail smears with his fingers.\n\n \n\nHarry: Hagrid, what's that?\n\nHagrid: What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.\n\nRon: {weakly} Okay.\n\nHagrid: And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}\n\nDraco: Okay. Then I get Fang!\n\nHagrid: Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nHarry and Draco are walking through the forest, Fang leading. Draco has the lamp.\n\n \n\nDraco: You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.\n\nHarry: If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.\n\nDraco: Scared, Potter?! {Scoffs} {howl} Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nThe group approaches a flat ground with gnarled roots all over. Fang stops, then growls.\n\n \n\nHarry: What is it, Fang?\n\n \n\nUp ahead, a cloaked figure is crouched over a dead unicorn, drinking its blood. The figure raises its head, silver blood dripping from its mouth.\n\n \n\nHarry gasps and grabs his scar, which is hurting.\n\n \n\nDraco: {A look of pure fear} AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! {runs away, with Fang} HELP!!!!!\n\n \n\nHarry is left by himself. The figure slides over the unicorn and rises erect. It advances towards Harry, who backs upbut trips. He crawls backwards. Suddenly, there is the sound of hoofbeats. A figure leaps over Harry and lands near the cloaked figure. It is a silver centaur, FIRENZE. It rears, and the cloaked figure retreats, flying away.\n\n \n\nFirenze: Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.\n\nHarry: {rises} But what was that thing you saved me from?\n\nFirenze: A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.\n\nHarry: But who would choose such a life?\n\nFirenze: Can you think of no one?\n\nHarry: Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?\n\nFirenze: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\n\nHarry: The Philosopher's Stone.\n\n \n\nSuddenly, a dog (Fang) barks. Harry looks up and sees Hagrid, Hermione, Ron and Draco appear.\n\n \n\nHermione: Harry!\n\nHagrid: Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}\n\nFirenze: Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.\n \n{Close up on the dead unicorn.}\n\n \nScene:\n\nGryffindor common room. Right after 'attack.' The group is around the fire. Hermione and Ron are seatedbut Harry stands.\n\n \n\nHermione: You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?\n\nHarry: But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}\n\nRon: But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?\n\nHarry: I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.\n\nRon: {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!\n\nHermione: Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?\n\n{The boys shrug.} Dumbledore! As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. {Harry smiles slightly.}\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nSome time later. In the outdoor courtyard. The three are walking.\n\n \n\nHermione: I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightfulbut I found that rather enjoyable.\n\nRon: Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?\n\nHarry: My scar. It keeps burning.\n\nHermione: It's happened before.\n\nHarry: Not like this.\n\nRon: Perhaps you should see the nurse.\n\nHarry: I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}\n\nHermione: What is it?\n\nHarry: Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?\n\nHagrid: I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.\n\nHarry: The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.\n\nHagrid: Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, \""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.\""\n\nHarry: And did he seem interested in Fluffy?\n\nHagrid: Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, \""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.\""\n\n \n\nThe three gape.\n\n \n\nHagrid: I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nMcGonagall's classroom. The three come tearing in and run up the aisles between desks. They pass a ghost and stop at the desk.\n\n \n\nHarry: We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!\n\nMcGonagall: I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.\n\nHarry: He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nMcGonagall: {shocked} How do you know\n\nHarry: Someone's going to try and steal it.\n\nMcGonagall: I don't know how you three found out about the stonebut I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. {They leave.}\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nAfter exiting McGonagall's class, they walk down the hallway.\n\n \n\nHarry: That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.\n\nHermione: And with Dumbledore gone\n\n{Snape suddenly appears behind them}\n\nSnape: Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?\n\nHermione: Uh...we were just...\n\nSnape: You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}\n\nHermione: Now what do we do?\n\nHarry: We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.\n\n \n\nScene: Nighttime. In the Gryffindor Common Room. The three friends come down the stairs and begin to walk across the floor. They stop when they hear croaking.\n\n \n\nHarry: Trevor.\n\nRon: Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!\n\nNeville: {appears behind a chair} Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?\n\nHarry: Now, Neville, listen. We were\n\nNeville: No! I won't let you! {stands} You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. {holds out fists.}\n\nHermione: Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus.\n\n \n\nNeville is frozen and falls backwards onto the ground. Hermione puts her wand back.\n\n \n\nRon: {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliantbut scary.\n\nHarry: Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.\n\nHermione: Sorry.\n\nRon: It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}\n\n \n\nScene: The three are under the Invisibility cloak, sneaking along the corridor.\n\n \n\nHermione: Ow! You stood on my foot!\n\nRon: Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.}\n\nHermione: Alohomora.\n\n \n\nThe door opens and they go in.\n\n \n\nRon: Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping.\n\nHarry: Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.}\n\nRon: Uh. It's got horrible breath!\n\nHarry: We have to move its paw.\n\nRon: What?!\n\nHarry: Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?\n\nHermione: The harp. It stopped playing.\n\n \n\nDrool from one head comes down on Ron's shoulder.\n\n \n\nRon: Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}\n\nHarry: Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.}\n\nRon: Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.\n\nHarry: Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.}\n\nHermione: Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.\n\nRon: Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!\n\n \n\nHermione manages a smile as she is sucked down below.\n\n \n\nRon and Harry: Hermione!!\n\nRon: Now what are we gonna do?!\n\nHermione's voice: Just relax!\n\nHarry: Hermione! Where are you?!\n\nHermione (from below): Do what I say. Trust me.\n\n \n\nHarry relaxes and is sucked through.\n\n \n\nRon: Ahh! Harry!\n\n \n\nHarry falls through and lands on the hard ground. Hermione goes over to him and he stands up.\n\n \n\nRon: Harry!\n\nHermione: Are you okay?\n\nHarry: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.\n\nRon: Help!\n\nHermione: He's not relaxing, is he?\n\nHarry: Apparently not.\n\nRon: Help! Help me!\n\nHermione: We've got to do something!\n\nHarry: What?\n\nHermione: Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron: Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! {takes out wand and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.}\n\nRon: Ahhh!\n\nHarry: Ron, are you okay?\n\nRon: Yeah.\n\nHarry: Okay.\n\nRon: {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!\n\nHarry: Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.\n\n \n\nThere is a sound.\n\n \n\nHermione: What is that?\n\nHarry: I don't know. Sounds like wings.\n\n \n\nThey enter into a room filled with golden \""birds.\""\n\n \n\nHermione: Curious. I've never seen birds like these.\n\nHarry: They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}\n\nHermione: What's this all about?\n\nHarry: I don't know. Strange.\n\n{Ron creeps over to the door and takes out his wand.}\n\nRon: {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try.\n\nHermione: Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!\n\nRon: We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.\n\nHarry: There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.}\n\nHermione: What's wrong, Harry?\n\nHarry: It's too simple.\n\nRon: Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!\n\n \n\nHarry nods and grabs the broom. All the keys suddenly go one direction, right at Harry. He climbs on, swiping at them.\n\n \n\nRon: This complicates things a bit!\n\n \n\nHarry pushes off into the air. He flies off, after the key. The others follow him. Harry grabs the key.\n\n \n\nHarry: Catch the key!\n\n \n\nHe zooms by and throws the key to Hermione, who catches it and heads for the lock while Harry distracts the other keys. Hermione puts it in the lock.\n\n \n\nRon: Hurry up!\n\n \n\nThe door opens, and Hermione and Ron rush through, followed by Harry. They shut the door just as the keys slam up against it.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nThey enter a dark room, with broken pieces all around it.\n\n \n\nHermione: I don't like this. I don't like this at all.\n\nHarry: Where are we? A graveyard.\n\nRon: This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}\n\nHarry: There's the door.\n\n \n\nThey walk across the board, towards the door. Suddenly, as they reach a line of pawns, the pawns bring up their swords. The three jump and back up.\n\n \n\nHermione: Now what do we do?\n\nRon: It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}\n\nHermione: What happens now?\n\nRon: {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}\n\nHermione: Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?\n\nRon: You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!\n\n \n\nThe game continues. Pieces smash each other, boom! Boom!\n\nRon: Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.\n\n \n\nHarry: Wait a minute.\n\nRon: You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.\n\nHarry: No, Ron! No!\n\nHermione: What is it?\n\nHarry: He's going to sacrifice himself!\n\nHermione: No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!\n\nRon: {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3.\n\n \n\nRon's horse moves forward, slides and stops.\n\n \n\nRon: Check.\n\n \n\nThe Queen turns and advances. Ron breathes faster, clutching the steel reins. The Queen stops. SMASH! Ron goes flying off the horse and lands on the floor, unconscious.\n\n \n\nRon: Ahhhh!\n\nHarry: RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.\n\nHermione: You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.\n\nHarry: Not as good as you.\n\nHermione: {smile} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.\n\n \n\nHarry nods and stands, walking away.\n\n \n\n\n \nScene:\n\nHarry walks down a long staircase to an empty room with pillars around it. The Mirror of Erised is in the middle of the room, and a man is standing before it. It is Quirrell. Harry yelps and grabs his scar.\n\n \n\nHarry: You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one\n\nQuirrell: Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to me, who would suspect, \""p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?\""\n\nHarry: B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.\n\nQuirrell: No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.\n\nHarry: Snape was trying to...save me?\n\nQuirrell: I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.\n\nHarry: Th-then you let the troll in.\n\nQuirrell: Very good Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. {Quirrell turns back to the mirror and Harry's scar hurts.} But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?\n\n{A raspy voice, VOLDEMORT, calls.}: Use the boy.\n\nQuirrell: Come here, Potter, now!\n\n \n\nHarry walks forward shakily.\n\n \n\nQuirrell: Tell me. What do you see?\n\n \n\nHarry looks in the mirror. He sees himself. His mirror self brings his hand into his pocket and takes out a red stone! The mirror self winks and puts the stone back. Very subtly, Harry reaches to his pocket. There is a lump. He gasps.\n\n \n\nQuirrell: What is it?! What do you see?!\n\nHarry: I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.\n\nVoldemort's voice: He lies.\n\nQuirrell: Tell the truth! What do you see?!\n\nVoldemort's voice: Let me speak to him.\n\nQuirrell: Master, you are not strong enough.\n\nVoldemort's voice: I have strength enough for this. {Quirrell unwraps his turban and on the side opposite his face, another face is planted. It is Voldemort who appears kind of like a snake. He stretches out and faces Harry via the mirror.} Harry Potter. We meet again.\n\nHarry: Voldemort.\n\nVoldemort: Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain mebut it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!\n\n \n\nHarry turns and runs.\n\n \n\nVoldemort: Stop him! {Quirrell snaps his fingers and fire erupts all around the room. Harry is stuck.} Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!\n\nHarry: {shakes his head} Never!\n\nVoldemort: Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. {In the mirror, Harrys parents faces appear.} All I ask for is something in return. {Harry takes the stone from his pocket.} That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! {Mother and father vanish.}\n\nHarry: You liar!\n\nVoldemort: Kill him!\n\n \n\nQuirrell soars into the air and smashes into Harry, one hand on Harrys throat. They fall to the steps. The stone falls out of Harry's reach as Quirrell chokes him. Harry strains and squeaks. Suddenly, Harry puts his hand on Quirrell's, trying to get him off. Smoke furls from under his hand.\n\n \n\nQuirrell: Ahh! Ahh! {backs up. His hand is crumbling into a mountain of black ash.} What is this magic? {hand dissipates.}\n\nVoldemort: Fool! Get the stone!\n\nQuirrell: {Walks forwardbut Harry puts both hands on his face.} Ahhhhhhhhhh!\n\n \n\nQuirrell backs up, then his face, which is horrendously burned, crumbles as he walks forward. His whole body is ash. He falls to the floor. Harry gasps. He looks at his own hands and hurries over to the stone. He picks it up and sighs, when he hears something. Turning, Harry sees a dust clouds with Voldemort's face. The cloud rushes forward, right through Harry!\n\n \n\nVoldemort: Arrrhhhhhh!\n\nHarry: Ahhhhhhhhh! {Voldemort flies away. Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the stone in an outstretched hand.}\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nThe hospital wing. Harry is bandaged, lying in bed. He awakens, puts on his glasses, and sits up. There are cards and candy all over. Dumbledore approaches him.\n\n \n\nDumbledore: Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?\n\nHarry: Admirers?\n\nDumbledore: What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. {Both smile.} Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.\n\nHarry: Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?\nDumbledore: Fine. They're both just fine.\n\nHarry: But, what happened to the Stone?\n\nDumbledore: Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.\n\nHarry: But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?\n\nDumbledore: {sits on the bed.} He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.\n\nHarry: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...\n\nDumbledore: Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find itbut not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. {Smile both.}\n\nHarry: Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?\n\nDumbledore: Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. {Harry touches his scar.} No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.\n\nHarry: What is it?\n\nDumbledore: Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...{takes brown bean and eats it.} Mm. Alas. Earwax.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nHarry approaches a room where up on a stairwell balcony Hermione and Ron are talking. They stop when they see Harry and lean over the railing.\n\n \n\nHarry: All right there, Ron?\n\nRon: All right? You?\n\nHarry: {shrug} All right. Hermione?\n\nHermione: {smile} Never better.\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nIn the great hall. All students are seated, and green banners with snakes on them are around the ceiling.\n\nDumbledore, at the head table, nods to McGonagall.\n\nShe dings her glass and the chatter stops. Dumbledore rises.\n\n \n\nDumbledore: Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.\n\n \n\nThere is immense cheering.\n\n \n\nStudents: Whoo! Yeah!\n\nDraco: Nice one, Mate! {sees Ron looking at him and sneers.}\n\nDumbledore: Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. {Applause.}\n\nHarry: {Pats} Good job.\n\nDumbledore: Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess {Ron looks at Harry and mouths, 'Me?' Harry nods, and mouths, 'You!'} that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. {Applause} And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. {Immense cheering.}\n\nHermione: We're tied with Slytherin!\n\nDumbledore: And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemiesbut a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.\n\n \n\nImmense cheering erupts. Neville is unbelieving, and sits there while cheering gets louder. Draco is downfallen.\n\n \n\nDumbledore: Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!\n\n \n\nCheering.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Yes! {grins}\n\n \n\nAll students stand and throw their hats into the air, except Draco, who smashes his down onto the table.\n\n \n\nSeamus: Neville! {Shakes his hand.}\n\n \n\nAll rub each other's hair and jump around, cheering and laughing.\n\n \n\nLee: Yeah! We won!! {Jumps with Harry, who looks back and grins very widely.}\n\n \n\nScene:\n\nThe outdoor train station. Students are walking around, getting in the train.\n\n \n\nHagrid: Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.\n\n \n\nHarry hands Hedwig to a train man, and walks to an open door of the train with Hermione. Hermione waves to Hagrid, who waves back. Hermione gets in the train.\n\n \n\nHermione: Come on, Harry.\n\nHarry: One minute. {He walks over to Hagrid.}\n\nHagrid: Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? {Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and hands it to Harry.} This is for you.\n\n \n\nHarry opens the album and sees a picture, moving, of him as a baby with his parents. They are all smiling and waving. Harry smiles.\n\n \n\nHarry: Thanks, Hagrid. {Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.}\n\nHagrid: Oh. Go on...on with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.\n\nHarry: But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.\n\nHagrid: I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? {chuckle} Off you go.\n\n \n\nHarry walks away, back to the train door where Hermione and Ron are waiting.\n\n \n\nHermione: Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?\n\nHarry: I'm not going home. Not really.\n\n \n\nThe train whistles and they climb aboard. As the train starts to leave and the camera pans up over the whole scene, Harry waves out the window to Hagrid, who waves back and then waves more to other students as the camera pans far back, then the credits begin."",

She amazes me everyday not just through her music but life in general. \""Who am I living my life for?\"" A very good question to ask yourself when you are having fear and doubts. Whether you're a 15 year old confused adolescent or a 55 year old retired grumpy grandma, always take a chance, take a risk. Great things never came from comfort zones. The most important decisions and most meaningful choices are characterized by uncertainty and by fear. Without uncertainty we have a safe, contained and predictable experience. We don’t have adventure. Life is an adventure. Adventure is the pursuit of life. Live with no regrets. Life is a beautiful ride and guess what, you are your own driver. Enjoy the ride. IT'S YOUR RIDE. I'm wishing you all a beautiful and meaningful ride out there. Again ask yourself, \""WHO AM I LIVING MY LIFE FOR?\"""",

They need a movie together with the rock and mark Wahlberg as well! I pray that all who may see this no matter what age gender race etc know that You are beautiful just as you are. If you/we ever forget I pray we allow God to remind us! You’re beautifully fearfully and wonderfully Hand made and crafted by God the Creator of all no matter what. As are they. As is everyone! Also know the Creator of All of the Universe the ENTIRE UNIVERSE who Created YOU!/Us loves us more than any other creation He created though we don’t deserve it. Isn’t that amazing? I pray if anyone may not know Jesus that you/they may come to. You’ll never regret it. Our relationship with Him is soooo personal. He loves us so much it’s amazing. It touches me to know I’m NEVER alone. He will NEVER leave nor forsake me. I can feel Him with me always. His love is contagious and I can feel it radiate through my bones and warm/wake my soul. Thank You God! I pray you may feel that too it’s free for the taking. It’s so simple to get. He loves you already so much He just wants us to accept Him so we can spend Eternity with Him and He can give us the life He knows we’d best fit and love and He can use us. Our sense of purpose validation hope joy peace and Salvation is Anchored in Him. Jesus is coming back soon and I pray as many as possible are willing may return to Heaven with Him. I’m thankful to know where I’m going! I mean this to let you know you’re loved no matter what! He is there for you. With you. Never going to leave you. He has His hand reached out to you ready to bring you in His arms. No matter what we may have done in the past present or future. He loves. He forgives. He mends broken Hearts. He saved. He’s the only person you can trust your heart and soul with. God bless you is my prayer. Your life is needed. You matter. God proves that. He reminds us of that daily. You have worth and purpose in Him. You’re valid as are your thoughts and feelings. It’s okay not to be okay. God helps us. He gives us recourses we may need. He is with us always. For eternity if we accept and choose Him. He has gifts He wants us to use or He wants to give us. He protects our Souls and Hearts. He corrects us in loving ways and wants nothing but the best for us He helps us through this scary world. He hung on The Cross for hours in so much pain. (Trigger warning about being beaten) Tendons showing bones out horrible pain.  He didn’t die because His body couldn’t take anymore He died because He decided when to give up the Ghost. He took the keys to Hell. He resurrected. On the Cross He said to God when they were doing such horrible things “Father they know NOT what they do” He took up for us. People often don’t know what to say when they pray. It doesn’t matter. Jesus translates/intercedes on our behalf to God. Jesus can take your emotions and translate them to God. Just pray to Jesus like when you’re talking to a friend. It doesn’t have to be proper or some by the book prayer. Jesus chose to die for us. A horrible death. He payed the price for our sins. He bought us. But He gives us free Will whether or not to choose Him. Anyone who goes to Hell is a stranger there. Hell is not meant for us. God gives us a choice. “If God loves us then why is hell an option or why do bad things happen” you might ask the answer is when Adam and Eve sinned in the Garden we then became sinners. We sin each day without knowing. We do bad things think bad things and that’s human. But God forgives us and loves us and says we don’t have to go to hell. We aren’t meant to. Sin is sin. There is no less bad or worse sin. It’s all horrible. But Jesus loves us anyways. When we go off and get in a hole of sin (even as saved Christians we still sin) He rescues us. He forgives us. That’s not an excuse to do it but it shows His love for us. Bad things happen on this earth because of the devil. Not because of God. “Why doesn’t he stop the devil” you might ask He promises to defeat the devil. The Victory is Won. If you know Jesus you’re on the Winning side. The devil is the god of this earth. But God has already defeated Him. Other peoples horrible actions and sins can bleed over into our lives causing bad things to happen. God doesn’t want that. I don’t know all the answers. God does. If you want to more I urge you to find out. My favorite Bible I’ve ever owned is a KJV life application Bible please read it for yourself. No matter what. Life application study Bibles break verses down so you can understand them. They are great. Thank You God! Have a great day today and tomorrow. Be safe! I hope 2022 so far has been a great year for you if not I hope the rest is. I hope the rest is anyway lol!  I hope the rest of your life is wonderful as well!  I pray your family, friends, loved ones, and most importantly yourself are all wrapped in a hedge of protection from any and all illnesses whether they be mental or physical. Including I pray God touches your life and gives you peace and strength. I pray your life is filled with happiness, success, love, peace, and joy. Have a great rest of your year. I hope you had of had a great year so far. I pray you have a great day/night. I pray God may use you and touch you. I hope y’all have a great day tomorrow! Spread love, peace, and kindness whenever you can. If you are ever going through a difficult time know that it is temporary and God is always there. If you need to talk about anything once again God is always there and feel free to talk to me bc we can talk about it if you need. I mean none of this by harm. I simply wish to bring joy to your life and a smile to your face. Know YOU ARE LOVED. If not by many you’re loved by Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. You’re loved by me although I may talk to you as much as I should or I’d like to. I pray you know you’re special, loved, worthy and KNOW you matter. God wouldn’t have created us if we all didn’t matter and have a purpose. He thinks of us constantly. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. I pray you have a GREAT rest of your evening, day, week, month, year, and  life. I am praying for you.

I know this is a lot but God put it on my heart to say some things. Thank You God for the love and feeling of the Holy Spirit. I pray you may know Him too. God bless you all. Jesus loves you infinitely He loves you more than anything else can because He loves us so much and He loves us more than anything else that exists. I love my Mom whole heartedly. Jesus loves her even more. Thank You God. I pray you may love Jesus feel His love on you. Love yourself through Him find in Him your worth validation happiness joy peace help hope most of all Salvation (with Salvation the others tend to follow even in the hard times) (please listen to “God on the mountain” by the gathers and “you’re not in this alone” by the Browders)  and I pray we all may love others through Him because He first loved us. He still does. He always will. No matter the pain you’ve gone through in your past He loves you. In Heaven there will be no pain! With Him we have peace. My mom sings a song that goes “Victory is mine God told Satan to get thee behind Victory today is mine Joy is mine Peace is mine Joy today is mine God told Satan to get thee behind Joy today is mine Salvation is mine Salvation is mine Salvation today is mine Love is mine love is mine happiness is mine happiness is mine GOD TOLD SATAN TO GET THEE BEHIND VICTORY TODAY IS MINE! Etc etc! “ Luke 4:8 “ And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.” KJV even Jesus was tempted/bothered by Satan never be afraid to rebuke. God bless you all. Jesus loves and ADORES YOU He died for you. He saves!"",

My mom sings a song that goes “Victory is mine God told Satan to get thee behind Victory today is mine Joy is mine Peace is mine Joy today is mine God told Satan to get thee behind Joy today is mine Salvation is mine Salvation is mine Salvation today is mine Love is mine love is mine happiness is mine happiness is mine GOD TOLD SATAN TO GET THEE BEHIND VICTORY TODAY IS MINE! Etc etc! “ Luke 4:8 “ And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.” KJV even Jesus was tempted/bothered by Satan never be afraid to rebuke. God bless you all. Jesus loves and ADORES YOU He died for you. He saves!"",

None of these people are no better than Brooke because they are definitely full of their own indiscretions yet very judgemental."",

Here is why:\r\u003cbr\u003ethe reason why there is a difference in time between two point in space at different distances from the Earth centre is  not dependent on the strength of the Earth&#39;s gravitational force as imaginarily assumedbut it lies in the radius distance or length from the Earth&#39;s centre to each different point in the Earth and  each different point  in space above the Earth&#39;s surface, and the translation from angular motion of each point due to the Earth&#39;s rotational motion to linear motion which move the Earth from one point to another point on its elliptical orbital path around the Sun\r\u003cbr\u003eLet&#39;s take an example to illustrate how it is so.  A person standing on a point on the Earth surface, and another person flying on an airplane above the standing person. Suppose that the airplane is  stationary above the standing person on the Earth&#39;s surface, and there is a straight line from the Earth&#39;s centre connecting the standing  person and the airplane. Let&#39;s call that radial line as the line of reference. When the Earth rotates an angle ϴ , the reference line also moves  to another point which is an arc or a circular distance away from its original position, and both the standing person and the airplane move at the same time , within the same interval, together with the reference linebut at different angular speed ω1 and ω2. From the angular motion translated to linear motion , we have linear velocities V1=ω1R1,  V2=ω2 R2.\r\u003cbr\u003e Since R2 which is the radial distance from the Earth&#39;s centre to the airplane is greater than the radial distance from the Earth&#39;s centre to the standing person on the Earth&#39;s surface R1, V2= ω2R2 &gt; V1= ω1R1, and  we&#39;ll have the linear displacement of the standing person as S1= θR1,  and the linear displacement of the airplane as S2 = θR2.\r\u003cbr\u003eSince R2 &gt; R1 , S2 &gt; S1. So, the time for the linear distance which the airplane has travelled is: \r\u003cbr\u003et2 = S2 / V2 = θR2 / ω2R2 = θ / ω2, and the linear distance which the standing has travelled is :\r\u003cbr\u003e t1 = S1/ V1 = θR1 / ω1R1 = θ / ω1\r\u003cbr\u003eSince the angles  of cicular motions of the standing person and the plane are the samebut the angular speeds of their circular motions are different due to the fact that  ω2 &gt; ω1  →  t2 &lt; t1, which means that the time for the airplane to travel and arrive at the same radial line of reference is smaller than the time for the standing person does because both the standing person and the airplane are still on the same radial straight line of reference when the line has moved to the new point on the circular path as the Earth has rotated an angle θ\r\u003cbr\u003eTherefore,  the difference in time between the standing person&#39;s motion and the airplane&#39; is the difference in time for their linear motions which are translated from their circular motions due to the difference in their radial distances between their different positions in space and the Earth&#39;s centrebut not due to the difference in  Earth&#39;s gravitational force&#39;s strength acting on them as how Einstein&#39;s imaginary theory of relativity says. In other words the difference in time here is caused by human-invented concepts of mathematicsbut not by any of natural phenonon as gravitational force\r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003eSimilarly, if you were in a spaceship travelling at almost the speed of light C from the Earth to anoth planet, the time for the spaceship to reach the other planet is the linear distance in space divided by the speed of lightbut the time here is totally based on the Earth&#39;s rotational motion ( just imagining that as the spaceship were moving away from the Earth, it moved to different lager  and larger adial distances from the Earth&#39;s centre)but not on the speed of the spaceship nor the distance it would have to travel to reach the other planet because the process of aging of  your physical body cells is the same as that of any human on this planetbut not that because you  would travel so fast as the speed of light that you would no longer be affected by the Earth&#39;s gravitational force, and that why your time in the spaceship from the Earth to the other planet would be shorter than the time calculated and based on the Earth&#39;s rotational motion for the spaceship to travel from the Earth to the other planet.\r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003eYou guys, especially those who are physicists and other scientists should have noticed that, the living environment for human bengs on this planet Earth is the most ideal onebut each human being&#39;s  existence or presence in this world is limited to usually under 100 revolutions which the Earth makes around the Sun, or under 100 x about 365 cycles of sunlight and darkness. Nowhere else in the universe has any better living conditions than the living conditions for human beings on the Earth&#39;s surface. So, the process of your physical body cells can only go faster than it does on the Earth when you were in the spaceship, travelling in the outer space away from the Earth to anywhere else in the universe. It means that the time which  you would experience in the outer space at the speed of light and so far away from the Earth that you would be almost no longer influenced by the Earth&#39;s gravitational field or force would be greater than the time calculated here on the Earth for the spaceship to travel from the Earth to the other planet. In other words, you would age faster than you do here on the Earth under less favourable living conditions or environment but not that you would live longer for several years due to time is slowed down when flying in the outer space to the other planet  as how ignorant human scientists have imaginarily claimed in many scientific research announcements  both on here Youtube and other sites. Such absurd claims are resulted from their mixing up human-invented concepts of mathematics and natural phenomena which have  little or nothing to do with such human subjective interpretations as their invented concepts of maths \r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003eLet&#39;s examine some other nonsensical  scientific claims by professors of physics at some universities to see why they have made such fundamental mistakes by confusing themselves in their mixing up human -invented concepts of  mathematics which obviously have so many flaws and defective holes and natural phenomena which human subjective interpretations can never ever influence nor determine\r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003e&#39;Gravity is slightly weaker on the top floor of a high building than at ground level, so the time dilation effect is also weaker higher up. Time goes faster the farther away you are from Earth&#39;s surface. Even though the effect is too small to detect with human senses, the time difference between different altitudes can be measured using extremely accurate clocks, as West Texas A&amp;M University physics professor Christopher Baird describes on his website(opens in new tab).\r\u003cbr\u003eTo see a more dramatic example of gravitational time dilation, we need to find somewhere with much stronger gravity than Earth, such as the neighborhood around a black hole. NASA(opens in new tab) has considered what would happen if a clock were put in orbit 6 miles (10 kilometers) from a black hole having the same mass as the sun. It turns out that when viewed through a telescope from a safe distance, the clock would take around an hour and 10 minutes to show a diffe&#39; \r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003eThat is an extracted passage from &quot;LifeSci=nce&quot; . The claim made by both Mr Baid and NASA here is obviously nonsensical because human-invented concept of time has do with only the Earth&#39;s rotational motion, not even with its gravitational field nor force, and the gravitational of a vague or undefined black hole is absolutely has nothing to do with with the Earth&#39;s rotational motion nor even with the interactions between the Sun and the planets within this so lar system. All what they have claimed here are totally their imagined theories without any evidence, like blindly copying Einstein&#39;s. \r\u003cbr\u003eIt totally depends on how faster a slower the Earth&#39;s rotational motion can be whether time can be slowed down or accelerated because time here is not any physical form of existence, being merely a symbolic value which human limited knowledge has borrowed or derived from the distances in space which the Earth&#39;s rotational motion makes along its circular path and elliptical orbit around the Sun. In other words, what the symbolic value of human-invented concept of time here actually represents is the distances which the Earth travels along its orbit, which are translated from its rotational motion about its axis\r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003eI will give you guys another simpler scientific explanation about why any point in space above the Earth&#39;s surface can reach a point ahead on the Earth&#39;s orbit around the Sun before another corresponding point on the Earth surface does. It is simply because that point in space has a greater radial distance away from the Earth&#39;s centre than the radial distance from the Earth &#39;s centre to the other corresponding point on the Earth&#39;s surface, and thus the linear displacement of the point in space is greater when translated from its circular displacement , and that point in space will obviously reach the point ahead on the Earth&#39;s orbit before the point on the Earth&#39;s surface does, although both of the points move at the same time and within the same time, thus have the same angle of circular motion. It is very much similar to a car with bigger wheels and a car with smaller wheel starting at the same point of time and running within the same period of timebut the one with bigger wheels will cover larger linear displacement or distance than the smaller-wheeled one. So, when you calculate the time for their linear displacements, there will be a difference in time  for their different linear displacement translated from their circular motions, despite the fact that the time intervals for their wheels&#39; circular or rotational  motions are the same."",

The claim made by both Mr Baid and NASA here is obviously nonsensical because human-invented concept of time has do with only the Earth's rotational motion, not even with its gravitational field nor force, and the gravitational of a vague or undefined black hole is absolutely has nothing to do with with the Earth's rotational motion nor even with the interactions between the Sun and the planets within this so lar system. All what they have claimed here are totally their imagined theories without any evidence, like blindly copying Einstein's. \r\nIt totally depends on how faster a slower the Earth's rotational motion can be whether time can be slowed down or accelerated because time here is not any physical form of existence, being merely a symbolic value which human limited knowledge has borrowed or derived from the distances in space which the Earth's rotational motion makes along its circular path and elliptical orbit around the Sun. In other words, what the symbolic value of human-invented concept of time here actually represents is the distances which the Earth travels along its orbit, which are translated from its rotational motion about its axis\r\n\r\nI will give you guys another simpler scientific explanation about why any point in space above the Earth's surface can reach a point ahead on the Earth's orbit around the Sun before another corresponding point on the Earth surface does. It is simply because that point in space has a greater radial distance away from the Earth's centre than the radial distance from the Earth 's centre to the other corresponding point on the Earth's surface, and thus the linear displacement of the point in space is greater when translated from its circular displacement , and that point in space will obviously reach the point ahead on the Earth's orbit before the point on the Earth's surface does, although both of the points move at the same time and within the same time, thus have the same angle of circular motion. It is very much similar to a car with bigger wheels and a car with smaller wheel starting at the same point of time and running within the same period of timebut the one with bigger wheels will cover larger linear displacement or distance than the smaller-wheeled one. So, when you calculate the time for their linear displacements, there will be a difference in time  for their different linear displacement translated from their circular motions, despite the fact that the time intervals for their wheels' circular or rotational  motions are the same."",

If I am passing a clock at high speed it may appear to slow down but that is just an illusion because I am moving, not because the clock is slowing down. It is an illusion and not a fact, just a wrong conclusion. Therefore Einstein and his followers are wrong."",

However, a photon emitted from a star in Andromeda and heading out towards the Earth travels in a vacuum and, because it&#39;s a photon, travels at the speed of light. Because the photon is moving at the speed of light it has a 100% time dilation factor. To the photon time does not exist until it strikes the upper atmosphere of our planet and even then is only slowed down by a tiny fraction.

Units for time and distance approach zero. \n\n \n\nAccording to 'relativity', mass cannot reach light speed. Why? Toward light speed mass increases to infinity. Therefore the amount of energy required is Infinite. Again, If an object accelerates toward 300, 0000 Kms per second, its mass becomes infinite, ad does the energy required to move it. Thus no normal object can travel as fast or faster than the speed of light. But only light photons experience zero distance and zero time.\n\n \n\nThus if we, like Jesus, are spirit (weightless, raptured ) we can move at speed of light (glorified) and so experience timelessness. And so live forever!!\n\n \n\n\""There it was, the true Light coming into the world.\"" John 1:9, Isa. 49:6. \n\n \n\n\""In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye (speed of light), at the last trumpet call. For a trumpet will sound, and the dead [in Christ] will be raised imperishable (free and immune from decay), and we shall be changed (transformed).\"" 1 Cor15:52 \n\n \n\nChrist spiritually is Light! It is written :-\n\n \n\nHe transfigured before them. His face shining like the sun, and His clothes as white as the light Matthew 17:2 His clothes became shining, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten. Mark 9:3 \n\n \n\nIs Christ a rainbow, because white comprises colours and Christ also is a ‘promise of God’? Rainbow appears in Genesis and Revelation. Revelation reveals a rainbow is around Christ. Rainbows require rains. It is written “In the latter days I will pour out my spirit”.\n\n \n\nOne of the purposes of space (a vacuum) is, to facilitate the speed of light, a speed where time and distance do not exist. \n\n \n\n(To state the obvious: light travels at the speed of light. So the question is how can it do this, and why doesn't it need infinite energy to go that fast? The answer is that particles of light (called photons) don’t have any mass. However, a photon emitted from a star in Andromeda and heading out towards the Earth travels in a vacuum and, because it's a photon, travels at the speed of light. Because the photon is moving at the speed of light it has a 100% time dilation factor. To the photon time does not exist until it strikes the upper atmosphere of our planet and even then is only slowed down by a tiny fraction. According to a photon in free space, time, or for that matter distance, has no meaning whatsoever, and it gets from wherever it is to wherever it is going instantly)"",

I have worked since I was 17. (I’m 64 now) I’ve been married 3 times, and 3 times the marriages failed. I could give you all the details of those heartbreaking outcomesbut I don’t like putting my side of story out there without the other person being included to defend themselves. So, I just leave it at the marriages failed for specific reasons. I know this may sound a little arrogant but, my first two failed marriages was nothing I did, or didn’t do. I considered myself a hard working woman, the best mother, and wife I knew how to bebut it failed in-spite of my 100% dedication to the marriages. My third marriage, well, I have to take full responsibility for the failure of that one. It was truly heartbreaking for me, and have always considered it, “The one that got away!” But there was just too much baggage from the first two I ha not come to terms with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, as to NOT make this a looong story, although, it is, I’ll get to the heart of my search for some much needed financially support. I’m not afraid of hard work and have been working since I was 17. However, from the year of 2015 to 2018, I didn’t work for those 3 years, due to the death of my son, by suicide. I was pretty much dysfunctional. And found it difficult to even get out of bed. During that time I had a very sweet, loving, compassionate, friend, that paid my rent and other expenses. I draw a disability check but, it doesn’t cover a lot, as it just isn’t enough to make ends meet. She, (my friend) to say the least,  was my guardian Angel. I also had others help me along the way too. Other friends that helped. Well, only a couple of other friends, and a family member. Who did their best when he/they could. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never expected to be 64 years of age still working, living from pay check to pay check. I live in fear of becoming homeless one day. But I keep a positive attitude that my financial break through is just around the corner. One day soon!!! (as I mentioned) I’m 64 I  would love to own my own house where I can open my doors to those in need, just as they opened their doors to me. My other desire is to pay back some of the money that was given to me when I needed it. No one has ever asked for it backbut that’s beside the point. It is my desire to give it back, so that they may use it to help others as they helped me. I also, have a very good friend that has helped me pay a few bills when I needed the money, like an electric bill, car payment (my car is paid off nowbut is in need of some repairsbut thankfully, continues to get me to and from work) My other friend (Cindy) that offered and gave me help, even though she had very little herself, unfortunately, her roof caved in on her home in one of her bedrooms and is in need of that being fixed. She gave a roofer $7,500 down (money her father left her in his “Will,”) as a down payment for the repairsbut sadly, he took off with the money, never to be seen, found, or heard from again. Now, the roof has literally caved in on her and a dear friend that lives with her, that she rescued from a nursery home, and a not very good one at that. My friend said, “She just couldn’t leave her there.” Now she feels she’s letting her friend down. Black mold will soon set in from the rain that seeps through as they’ve tried to patch it up. In my honest opinion - it just needs be be removed (the whole house) and she needs a “new, all in one piece home. (She lives in a mobile home.)\u003cbr\u003eI would love to receive my desirable financial support to help do all the things I have mentioned above for the others, before, I tell you the desires of my own personal needs. PLEASE understand I am not looking for pity, or playing on anyones sympathy for my friends or myself. These are legitimate needs.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike I said, I live on disability (due to deep depression after my sons death) I do work in retail making $10.45 an hour. Drawing disability, you have a fixed amount of $1,259 (gross) a month you can make in addition to your disability. This makes paying for just the basic needs nearly impossible. My disability is $969. I work part time, and maybe, if lucky, 20 hours a week. My rent alone is $880 a month. But its good comfortable, safe, home. Thats Cheap compared to others homes I looked at. If I want cockroaches for room mates,  I suppose I could go cheaper. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst and foremost, I would love to find a way to help my friend Cindy and her friend to repair their roof and a few other things that will make her home safely inhabitable. As they both are not in good health….\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to GIVE BACK some of the financial support shared with me by guardian Angel I mentioned before. She turned 100 years old this last January. Oh, how I would love to give back some of the thousands of dollars she gave me.  Before she leaves this world. I pray for a miracle concerning that and pray she is still here when my miracle comes through. If not, I will give it to her family. I do understand it’s a tall miracle I’m praying for. But, nonetheless, I will continue to pray! And anything is possible! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love to own my home one day so I am not at the mercy of others if I stay, or if I go. Most times it’s because they want to sell. I pay my rent each month on time, and take care of the home as though “I did” own it. I haven’t paid the $880 deposit my landlord requested but, agreed to take payments. I just do not have the extra to offer him. And this hangs over my head daily! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have set up a GoFundMe for my friend with the roof and other issues with her home. It is under: Cindy Shelton. You can find her at the link below. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\""https://gofund.me/4ff15a1a\""\u003ehttps://gofund.me/4ff15a1a\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you or anyone you know can help us, it would be a prayer answered. If you can’t it will be completely understood. I’m hoping you will share my story and share the GFM link above for my friend Cindy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWaiting to hear from you…\u003cbr\u003ePlease no scammers. We can’t take anymore disappointment, unfulfilled promises, or rip offs! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time. \u003cbr\u003eYou an contact me through my email address Susieqx3@\u003ca href=\""http://aol.com/\""\u003eaol.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCall me crazy but, I truly believe and have faith that this message will get to the right person of Gods choosing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you for your undevided attention and your time! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI’m open to ANY and ALL questions you may have…..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreat full either way, \u003cbr\u003eSusan"",

My third marriage, well, I have to take full responsibility for the failure of that one. It was truly heartbreaking for me, and have always considered it, “The one that got away!” But there was just too much baggage from the first two I ha not come to terms with. \n\nAnyway, as to NOT make this a looong story, although, it is, I’ll get to the heart of my search for some much needed financially support. I’m not afraid of hard work and have been working since I was 17. However, from the year of 2015 to 2018, I didn’t work for those 3 years, due to the death of my son, by suicide. I was pretty much dysfunctional. And found it difficult to even get out of bed. During that time I had a very sweet, loving, compassionate, friend, that paid my rent and other expenses. I draw a disability check but, it doesn’t cover a lot, as it just isn’t enough to make ends meet. She, (my friend) to say the least,  was my guardian Angel. I also had others help me along the way too. Other friends that helped. Well, only a couple of other friends, and a family member. Who did their best when he/they could. \n\nI never expected to be 64 years of age still working, living from pay check to pay check. I live in fear of becoming homeless one day. But I keep a positive attitude that my financial break through is just around the corner. One day soon!!! (as I mentioned) I’m 64 I  would love to own my own house where I can open my doors to those in need, just as they opened their doors to me. My other desire is to pay back some of the money that was given to me when I needed it. No one has ever asked for it backbut that’s beside the point. It is my desire to give it back, so that they may use it to help others as they helped me. I also, have a very good friend that has helped me pay a few bills when I needed the money, like an electric bill, car payment (my car is paid off nowbut is in need of some repairsbut thankfully, continues to get me to and from work) My other friend (Cindy) that offered and gave me help, even though she had very little herself, unfortunately, her roof caved in on her home in one of her bedrooms and is in need of that being fixed. She gave a roofer $7,500 down (money her father left her in his “Will,”) as a down payment for the repairsbut sadly, he took off with the money, never to be seen, found, or heard from again. Now, the roof has literally caved in on her and a dear friend that lives with her, that she rescued from a nursery home, and a not very good one at that. My friend said, “She just couldn’t leave her there.” Now she feels she’s letting her friend down. Black mold will soon set in from the rain that seeps through as they’ve tried to patch it up. In my honest opinion - it just needs be be removed (the whole house) and she needs a “new, all in one piece home. (She lives in a mobile home.)\nI would love to receive my desirable financial support to help do all the things I have mentioned above for the others, before, I tell you the desires of my own personal needs. PLEASE understand I am not looking for pity, or playing on anyones sympathy for my friends or myself. These are legitimate needs.  \n\nLike I said, I live on disability (due to deep depression after my sons death) I do work in retail making $10.45 an hour. Drawing disability, you have a fixed amount of $1,259 (gross) a month you can make in addition to your disability. This makes paying for just the basic needs nearly impossible. My disability is $969. I work part time, and maybe, if lucky, 20 hours a week. My rent alone is $880 a month. But its good comfortable, safe, home. Thats Cheap compared to others homes I looked at. If I want cockroaches for room mates,  I suppose I could go cheaper. \n\nFirst and foremost, I would love to find a way to help my friend Cindy and her friend to repair their roof and a few other things that will make her home safely inhabitable. As they both are not in good health….\n\nI would love to GIVE BACK some of the financial support shared with me by guardian Angel I mentioned before. She turned 100 years old this last January. Oh, how I would love to give back some of the thousands of dollars she gave me.  Before she leaves this world. I pray for a miracle concerning that and pray she is still here when my miracle comes through. If not, I will give it to her family. I do understand it’s a tall miracle I’m praying for. But, nonetheless, I will continue to pray! And anything is possible! \n\nI would love to own my home one day so I am not at the mercy of others if I stay, or if I go. Most times it’s because they want to sell. I pay my rent each month on time, and take care of the home as though “I did” own it. I haven’t paid the $880 deposit my landlord requested but, agreed to take payments. I just do not have the extra to offer him. And this hangs over my head daily! \n\nI have set up a GoFundMe for my friend with the roof and other issues with her home. It is under: Cindy Shelton. You can find her at the link below. \n\nhttps://gofund.me/4ff15a1a\n\nIf you or anyone you know can help us, it would be a prayer answered. If you can’t it will be completely understood. I’m hoping you will share my story and share the GFM link above for my friend Cindy. \n\nWaiting to hear from you…\nPlease no scammers. We can’t take anymore disappointment, unfulfilled promises, or rip offs! \n\nThank you for your time. \nYou an contact me through my email address Susieqx3@aol.com\n\nCall me crazy but, I truly believe and have faith that this message will get to the right person of Gods choosing. \n\nAgain, thank you for your undevided attention and your time! \n\nI’m open to ANY and ALL questions you may have…..\n\nGreat full either way, \nSusan"",

            ""textOriginal"": ""OLD CAPTAIN BONE SPURS TRUMP THIS WORKING MAN'S\n\""'CHAMPION\""\nFirst cowardly act was when after attending a military school for 6 years when finally called up for active duty to his country the pussy dodges the draft by faking bone spurs lol!!\nInherited $400 Million from Daddy.\nNever did household chores.\nNever fixed a car.\nNever went grocery shopping.\nNever mowed a lawn.\nIs almost 80 and wears makeup and colors\nhis hair.\nHad a golden toilet made for himself.\nHas been chauffeured around his entire life.\nHe doesn't give a fuck about\nus. \nStop being a sucker\nSo if you are a trump supporter & you are watching the January 6 hearings & you are seeing video clips of evidence and truths about what actually happened & you are feeling a little confused angry & betrayed, That’s understandable.\nIf you believe trumps lies and that the election was stolen then that is not your fault! \nThe president of the United States lied to you! \nHe lied to you for his own benefit.\nHe lied to you to stay in power.\nHe lied to you to grift money.\nMore than $250,000,000 that he didn’t use for an election defence fund like he told you! But transferred it into another account so he could do whatever he wanted with it. \nHe lied to you because the presidency was profitable and he didn’t want to let it go for that reason.\nHe was legally untouchable, His hotels were thriving & he had the respect and power he thought he deserved. \nThe country spent $150 million for him to visit his own properties. \nHis daughter made $640,000,000 from her Chinese trade marks and businesses all while working at the White House as a made up position of advisor to the president.\nHis son in law made off with $650,000,000 of campaign money & also made $2 billion from the people who blew up the twin towers.\nThe Republican national committee paid the rest of his children,their spouses & girlfriends just to exist! \nJared & Ivanka got $640 million as\nWhite House advisors\""\nIvanka got 18 trademarks from\nChina\nJared got $2 billion from the Saudis\nJared got $6.35 million in PPP loan\nmeant for small businesses\nIvanka, Jr & Eric stole charity funds\nBut tell us more about Hunter's\nlaptop.\nIt was a racket! \nBut as long as he was still perceived as a winner he could still ask you for money. Everyone in his circle knew Trump was lying to you But they let him & let him away with it because it served them as it served their desire for power their agenda & their book sales. \nIt served the election laws they changed in the name of his lies. \nIt served their desire for one party rule!\nHe lied to you! They all lied to you!\nAnd it is not your fault as you are supposed to be able to believe the word of the President of the United States!\nYou are supposed to be able to believe your news channel!\nYou are supposed to be able to believe the lawyers who speak with authority on television!\nBut they lied and they will keep lying Because they think you won’t check!\nI think you won’t change the channel or watch the hearings or even use your own minds to figure it out!\nThey conned you and they think they can keep on conning you!\nBut this isn’t something you should keep feeling bad about as it is not your fault.\nIt is something they should feel bad about but they won’t because they don’t care!\nThe question is do you care!? \nObviously not if your supporting Trump!\n\nAfter a lifetime of Criminality, the tide is finally turning on Donald Trump. As the prosecution for committing the worst Crime in Presidential history heats up, the GOP is starting to abandon him. Soon he will be left with only Indictments and Humiliation.\n\nIt is shameful how trumps authoritarian regime has hijacked the American flag and the term “patriot.” But as C. S.

Trump signed the law after he spent years accusing Hillary Clinton Of illegally storing documents on a private email server. \n\nOh the irony!\n\nNow the Trumpanzees are lying crying accusing Biden of weaponizing the DOJ for a political agenda That’s rich considering Trump tried to weaponize the DOJ at least 25 times for his own political gain\n\nBut it is much bigger than that! \nGiven Trumps connections & loyalty to foreign communist authoritarian dictators such as  Kim Jong Un & Putin of whom he constantly tries to align himself with,Any possible sensitive material especially when it comes to military nuclear weapons in the hands of Traitorous Trump is a concern & merits a search via probable cause. Not to mention any sensitive government material of which could land in the wrong hands or possibly the highest bidder. Everybody knows Trump is callous with the security of any sensitive documentation of which should have been preserved in the US National archives.\n\nThis warranted search needed to be done! \n\nTrump 5150"",

Shine a 390 nanometer light(black light) through a one inch hole in the top of a large cardboard box filled with outside air, and sitting on the ground to see what is being sprayed on you! Post it!  Comments are being suppressed, to cover up a genocide happening like during WW2, news media no commenting =propaganda, which can't stand scrutiny.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic and now under a corona virus /monkey pox pandemic.  It is not Russia or China spraying American skies in parallel lines.  It is not China or Russia venting gases to take your breath away in your dwellings.  You need a radiation detector and an air quality monitor with logging.  It usually happens at night while you sleep and you probably don't even know.  Vaccines(Computer vaccines) hide information from you.  When you think that they are talking about real viruses, they are actually taking about electronic generated information that they must suppress by forcing a computer anti virus signature that looks for information and deletes it from your view. NATO is the military arm of Revelation17,18, and is about to start a war with China, saying they attacked Taiwan.  Taiwan until very recently was acknowledged by the majority of all nations of the world as being part of China.  Taiwan has no embassy, as they are not a Country.  It was just recently changed on US documents in order to start the coming war.  The US has just passed a law similar to the one during WW2, to supply endless weapons to Taiwan.  WW2 China was attacked from Taiwan after it's invasion by Japan.  Donald Trump told 3.5years in advance how the US would soon be waging war with Russia and China.  This is all staged by Rome.  The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State of Rome Italy.  He rules over the soon to be ten Nations of the Roman Empire.  The Country is the smallest in the world, and has its own flag and representatives in the UN, and other political bodies.  The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Churchbut also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms.  Empires in the Bible are referred to as beasts, and Rome's image to represent it is the cross or X, which symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,\""get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her\"". Revelation 18:4 Get out of her \""MY PEOPLE!\""  Ukraine killed NAZI Pow's because they were talking.  Revealing their NAZI affiliations.  The Red Cross is part of the Roman system masquerading as an aid organizationbut is military intelligence.  It has the (M.O.B.) mark of the beast as it's emblem.   Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a Western backed coup in 2014, which forensic evidence told a different story than video evidence, so there was  a conspiracy.  Western media changed the name of the Ukraine Capital from a Russian name to some thing else.  The Russian language, history and culture were hidden and suppressed.  Those with out blue arm bands would be put to death by Ukrainian forces run by foreigners.  Zellensky says that Ukraine will become a Catholic State under the Pope, and that is why Roman Catholics Nancy Palosi and Joe Biden are supporting the war against Ukraine and Russia.  Imagine Germany flying in to PEI(Prince Edward Island) Canada against Canada's wishes and saying they will supply them with unlimited arms to fight Canada.  Eighty five percent of the people of PEI don't want to separate.  Then Germany says that Canada is flying over PEI's air space, and makes the world think that Canada is violating PEI. Germany sends military jets of theirs and Japan's to escort a woman to PEI to stir this up, a long with 5 aircraft carrier battle groups. Imagine that!  Or what if this happened to Alaska?  Well this is happeningbut not to PEIbut to Taiwan and China.  Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Countrybut part of Canada.  It was not Germanybut backed by NATO.  The Pope's terror squad. The US and Japan are militarizing an Island near Taiwanbut NATO said they would attack the Soloman Islands if they militarize.(not if they attack, just militarizing) These wars are to hide Revelation 17,18's identity, and to distract you from the 1918/WW2 like genocide.  Comments are being edited by G7 Nations.(security reasons). Truth can stand on it's own two feetbut lies have to be propped up. Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023 Executive Order 14067 sec#4 to control buying and selling.  WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a \""temporary\"" measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it's use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. 85% of Taiwanese want to remain a part of Chinabut that does not stop Rome from fomenting an other war to distract people from it being publicly exposed as fraud.  All the fraudulent leaders must keep Rome propped up to keep their own deceptive systems a float. In the West, there is a lot of corrupt media pretending that Taiwan is it's own Country and China wants to absorb it. Religious people say follow Godbut in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth.  God tells you there, what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  People are following Satan as if God.  Why tax exempt(Cowardly officials) The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new name =different avenue of attack.   A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  *One* is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  *Two* the second is a so called virus that attacks humans with signs of sneezing, head pain and breathlessness, like when a person is radiated or gassed. Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing them to sneeze and eventually die(zyklon b, causing suffocation).  Look in to the sky and you will see planes spraying the sky in parallel patterns, just before an outbreak. Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  Man can live for everbut it is being hide from you, by people who want to dominate and suppress you.  There are already technologies to heat and power cars and houses with out requiring any fuel. You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. \nTechnology is  being exploited to do things that are not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech because it is doing some thing it is not supposed to.  The government forces technogy to be breached by law enforcement, and then exploited for evil ends.  Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  They are trying to shut down microprocessor production.  Why did Nancy Pelosi by military escort breach a sovereign Nation's land where the microprocessor's are made?  Think!  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire.  Look at early 15th century Magna Carta documents where it talks how Rome will pay back for the wholesale slaughter of populations.  It says to lock them down then go in and exterminate.  \u200bIt was done under the guise of a typhus epidemic by Austrian/German Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler during WW2, and now they are doing it under a corona virus pandemic/ monkey pox pandemic. On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Russia built and controls the nuclear power plant and would not bomb themselves. Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. Gog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars. Scott Ritter confirms US and UK committing war crimes in Ukraine.  Are NATO forces going to attack China from an Island near Taiwan?  Joe Biden building a government army 86000 people willing to use deadly force against Americans. !(!(((("",

            ""textDisplay"": ""Good morning! Thank you very much for sending me a full transcript of Michael Heseltine's speech from the rally you attended attended on Saturday, 19th October, 2019. I did, indeed, have a very pleasant Saturday, thank you. Before going any further, may I say, that I am quite well-aware that you do not suffer from any mental health issues? My comments in that regard were ironic in naturebut unfortunately on this occasion your interpretational skills seem to have eluded you. The comments were not intended to diminish in any way the real mental health issues that people suffer from. My mindset giving rise to my response to your comments from a couple of days ago were that I found it quite extraordinary that an individual, in this case you, could find the time to trawl through presumably various websites from several weeks ago and find a one-line comment praising, presumably working-class (good on them) Welsh men for standing-up to Gina Miller and making a comment about that! That is why I said that it could take you a considerable period of time to respond to the comments made by many others about Gina Miller. As your response is mainly taken up with the transcription of Michael Heseltine's speech I shall just comment on the several personal points that you do make. The UK initially joined what was then called the 'Common Market' this latterly became known as the 'European Economic Area' (EEC). This then morphed into the European Union with national boundaries and indigenous populations and cultures being subsumed all over the European continent within this behemoth. Whilst peace can obviously be achieved through mutual trade and cooperation - and this is how it has always been - it certainly doesn't take the eradication of nation states for this to be achieved. I note that you visited the war memorial to pay your respects and thought about the futility of war and the needless waste of millions of lives. I totally agree with the sentiments you expressed here, and who in their right mind wouldn't? However, by voting to leave Europe, ie the European Union, trade would not be diminished as the UK buys billions of pounds more in goods than they buy from us. So, are the likes of European pharmaceutical companies and German car manufacturer's etc. going to cut off their noses to spite their faces? Of course the 'remain' fraternity would have you believe that it will only be the Uk that suffers. Following on from this if trade tariffs were to be imposed by the European Union, as mentioned above  as we buy billions of pounds more in goods from them than they buy from us, who would be the loser there? Leaving the European Union isn't a case of the UK 'pulling up the drawbridge'. The UK will still trade with Europe and more importantly with the wider world. I wonder how the United Kingdom ever survived prior to the formation of the European Union? Many millions of people who voted to leave the EU probably lived through and also fought in WW11 and suffered countless privations and losses but all the scare stories never deterred them form wanting out. As to your your concluding remarks in which I believe you meant to refer to the 1939-1945 war and the Nuremberg trial for atrocities carried-out by the Nazis. This is an extremely poor choice of analogy. If you are equating the 17.4 million people in the UK who voted to leave the European Union with the Nazi ideology then I, and millions of others will find that highly offensive!  Finally you state your causes and beliefs and ask what I fight for. I fight against the implementation of foodbanks, I fight for the rights of the downtrodden and less well off. But, one of the things I believe in most of all is for democracy to be upheld no matter the result and not for countless obstacles to be thrown in the path of the result being implemented. I hope you have a good day! Best wishes! Well done the Welsh blokes!"",

            ""textDisplay"": ""Jeon Jungkook. I want to start by talking about your musicality in this sense, more specifically, your voice. You have the most healing, soothing, calming, and passionate voice I have heard in my life.  You have such a breathy, gorgeous vocal tone that ignites every single word that you sing.  It is one action to speakbut sometimes what you sing says more to us than what mere words could ever. Your voice is as gentle and comforting as a lullabybut as powerful and soulful as a person’s spirit. You can bring tears to those who aren’t sensitive, and put a spring in the step of those who feel lifeless. You’re the only person who I know encompasses so much talent and possibility in one voice. You tell stories, give advice, and release pain just by singing for us. Just as your singing serves as an entire mind and body experience for the listener, your dancing is equally as imperative as a component for your exquisite performances. You have all of the skills and marks of a phenomenal dancerbut when you dance your body absorbs the music. Your body moves and becomes one with the rhythm, and watching you fall into the music to let yourself go makes us feel liberated. Whether it be contemporary, hip-hop, or any other style, your body naturally adapts to the atmosphere and every little morsel of composition. Only you have the blood in your veins that pumps through it the essence of dance; of which no amount of training or practice could be put in to acquire. Needless to say, you have reached new heights in the world as well as within yourself musically. You’ve quite clearly taken the globe by storm as you have emerged as one of the most iconic artists in this generation; and furthermore, in this world. You’ve revolutionized the sound and meaning of music; as well as performance etiquette. There will literally never be another artist to grace this Earth like you again, so we will live through and spread the history that you have made with each passing day. Thank you for your legacy in music and for discovering more about it each time you associate with it. As much as I love your musicality, I love your personality all the same. After years of being in this line of work, you’ve only maturedbut never lost who you are at your core. You are astonishingly humble and I always marvel at this especially given how admirable of a person that you are. Most importantly, you are the greatest friend a person could ask for and I know that your members love this about you more than anybody else. You are so intriguing in that your members have always wanted to protect you, yet they want to learn from you and look up to you all the same. The past several years of knowing them, no doubt have been the greatest and you are at the heart of the memories that make them who they are. You give them youth, energy, strength, determination, and belief in themselves.  Where the other boys may see insecurities and imperfections in themselves, all you have ever seen is beauty and perfection. They wouldn’t know their worth if you hadn’t spent the past years of their lives raising them and instilling in them the values to live a satisfied and rewarding life. Army just want to thank you for filling every single second of your members’ lives since you’ve met with the greatest memories and stories worth telling. Thank you for helping them grow and evolve, all while ensuring that they listen to their heart. Thank for changing their lives forever, and becoming a brother that will remain a part of their soul even in death. I want to personally thank your family and parents for raising you and helping you to become the irreplaceable light that you represent in this world. I have no doubt that you family is one of your biggest, if not the one reason that you are able to be where you are today. I know that they helped you and allowed you to reach your dream. I’ve heard you thank them and consider them so many times along your journey and I know that you keep them with you everywhere that you go. You will get lost and might feel like you can’t ever find your way backbut your family will always be your guidance. There is no situation too severe that they could not save you from and help you through. They support you more than anybody else in this world. You honor them will all that you do and attest to the way they raise you with the life you lead. Don’t ever think you disappoint them because you are their greatest love and dream in this life. They will always love you and be proud of you more than anybody else in this world. As ARMY, we keep them in our hearts as you do and strive to be as gentle and impactful to others as they are. Jungkook, I was unaware of the depth that could exist in a relationship between fans and idols until you came into my life. So much has changed in your life since you started, and I realize that one of the constants that has never changed, only gotten stronger, is ARMY and our love for you. You don’t let your walls come down entirely until you are with us or your members, and we get to see you as realistically as possible without meeting you in person. We live our day to day lives working hard because we know that you are somewhere several miles away doing the same for us. We’ve seen you go through a lot and though it is unbearable to see you down at all, we are so lucky that you trust us enough to see you in these conditions. You work so hard for us; pushing your body and mind past its limit just to make us happy and we don’t deserve you straining yourself for just one performance. Not to make you feel overwhelmedbut you have literally saved the lives of hundreds, maybe even thousands of ARMY who have wanted to give up on themselves. You give us all the strength, love, and faith that we need to live the best life, even if it means giving some of your own basic needs to us. I want to thank you for making our lives so worthy and making us individually feel like we are on top of the world. No matter when they meet you, it feels like they’ve had years of the greatest and most emotional memories that will be treasured and honored in the most sensitive part of our hearts. Thank you for helping the millions of ARMY fulfill their destiny in life and for giving them a place of bliss to return to that lies within you.  We could never forget that the best years of our lives will be defined by you. I know that you’ve been through a lot, both personally and professionally. We’ve been trusted enough to see some of what you gone through, whether it be physically, mentally, or in any other way. Like aforementioned, even if you are in the slightest bit unhappy, it is unbearable and overwhelming to see.  We’ve already seen too muchbut it breaks our hearts to know that we might not even know the half of it. You’ve been working for so long, and essentially gave up your youth for all of us. I can’t imagine how hard it might have been on you at times. Given this, all I can say on behalf of all of your loved ones is that we are so beyond proud of you for making it past all of your struggles. I know that you’ve found true happiness and have felt alive doing what you do, and we are just so thankful that you are able to overcome what ails you. When the time comes, you are able to remain optimistic and turn your pain into productivity.  Every time, you come out on the other side so much more mature and experienced. We all look up to you in this sense because you see every difficult moment as a time to learn and grow. We learn from you in this way, and we know that no matter what you face in the future, you will be able to face it with confidence. I hope that this birthday makes all of your dreams come true, and that you get accomplish all that you desire to today.  I hope that your ARMY serve as a vacation for you today and allow you to just breathe in the life that surrounds you. I hope you are able to look at us, see the people we’ve become, and recognize all of the countless hearts you’ve mended. I hope you can take this day to see all that you have done for this world in over eight years. I wish that those around you also help you to realize what a cherished spirit and soul that you are. I hope you get to relax today, and that this goes down as one of the best days you've ever had! Those who love you most will help you make only the best memories that you can always look back on! You deserve all of the blessings, success, and happiness that you have; and I know that there’s only more to come! Please have fun and spend every second doing what you love! Thank you so much for sacrificing so much just to make BTS and so many of your solo projects possible. Thank you for suffering through any pain, fatigue, doubt, confusion, isolation, concern, hardship, loneliness, and so much more just to bring us the slightest bit of content at all.  Of course I want you to work until you are satisfied with yourselfbut I don’t want you to stress because you want it to be perfect for us. You are already perfect to us and beautiful inside and out. It feels like living in a dream with you and our lives are now not complete without you in it. You are our whole world and heart, and no matter what happens in the future or where you go, you have our undying, unwavering, unconditional love. You are our inspiration in this life where everything is scary and uncertain, and I can’t thank you enough for blessing all of us by sacrificing so much of your time. We can’t wait to see where you go in the future. We will by your side for infinity and support you always. I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future. Happy birthday Jeon Jungkook, and we adore you so much!!!!!!"",

You give them youth, energy, strength, determination, and belief in themselves.  Where the other boys may see insecurities and imperfections in themselves, all you have ever seen is beauty and perfection. They wouldn’t know their worth if you hadn’t spent the past years of their lives raising them and instilling in them the values to live a satisfied and rewarding life.

Jungkook, I was unaware of the depth that could exist in a relationship between fans and idols until you came into my life. So much has changed in your life since you started, and I realize that one of the constants that has never changed, only gotten stronger, is ARMY and our love for you. You don’t let your walls come down entirely until you are with us or your members, and we get to see you as realistically as possible without meeting you in person. We live our day to day lives working hard because we know that you are somewhere several miles away doing the same for us. We’ve seen you go through a lot and though it is unbearable to see you down at all, we are so lucky that you trust us enough to see you in these conditions.

You give us all the strength, love, and faith that we need to live the best life, even if it means giving some of your own basic needs to us. I want to thank you for making our lives so worthy and making us individually feel like we are on top of the world.

We’ve already seen too muchbut it breaks our hearts to know that we might not even know the half of it. You’ve been working for so long, and essentially gave up your youth for all of us. I can’t imagine how hard it might have been on you at times. Given this, all I can say on behalf of all of your loved ones is that we are so beyond proud of you for making it past all of your struggles. I know that you’ve found true happiness and have felt alive doing what you do, and we are just so thankful that you are able to overcome what ails you.

            ""textDisplay"": ""Jeon Jungkook. I want to start by talking about your musicality in this sense, more specifically, your voice. You have the most healing, soothing, calming, and passionate voice I have heard in my life.  You have such a breathy, gorgeous vocal tone that ignites every single word that you sing.  It is one action to speakbut sometimes what you sing says more to us than what mere words could ever. Your voice is as gentle and comforting as a lullabybut as powerful and soulful as a person’s spirit. You can bring tears to those who aren’t sensitive, and put a spring in the step of those who feel lifeless. You’re the only person who I know encompasses so much talent and possibility in one voice. You tell stories, give advice, and release pain just by singing for us. Just as your singing serves as an entire mind and body experience for the listener, your dancing is equally as imperative as a component for your exquisite performances. You have all of the skills and marks of a phenomenal dancerbut when you dance your body absorbs the music. Your body moves and becomes one with the rhythm, and watching you fall into the music to let yourself go makes us feel liberated. Whether it be contemporary, hip-hop, or any other style, your body naturally adapts to the atmosphere and every little morsel of composition. Only you have the blood in your veins that pumps through it the essence of dance; of which no amount of training or practice could be put in to acquire. Needless to say, you have reached new heights in the world as well as within yourself musically. You’ve quite clearly taken the globe by storm as you have emerged as one of the most iconic artists in this generation; and furthermore, in this world. You’ve revolutionized the sound and meaning of music; as well as performance etiquette. There will literally never be another artist to grace this Earth like you again, so we will live through and spread the history that you have made with each passing day. Thank you for your legacy in music and for discovering more about it each time you associate with it. As much as I love your musicality, I love your personality all the same. After years of being in this line of work, you’ve only maturedbut never lost who you are at your core.

Destello azul ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1eGtStQY-8\n\nEn el caso de que destello azul fuese el resultado de una comunicación estelar entre planetas y especies , el mal seria algo parecido a lo que ocurre en el quinto elemento  , si es un ser físico seria algo así como Bobbidi , mago que viaja a la tierra para recolectar energia y despertar a Majin-Boo. Existe un juego de palabras entre los nombres \""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\"", ya que aparecen en una canción de La Cenicienta, un clásico de Disney. Cenicienta ceniza . Las dos opciones son posibles siendo consecuencias reciprocas una de otra .  Bobbidi se reproduce algo similar a roger de padre made in usa .  \n\nPuede que sea bueno .\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha4VJoqSSys de otro bajo , bajo la manga.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odNGT0Rsiuw Opel tantra . \r\nla conversación musical es gracias a internet y su reproductor automático en yutube .\n\nOpel es la representación de un destello , la marca alemana de autos . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjpBs2BfNbw es curioso que opel en sus inicios se dedicase a las maquinas de coser .No encuentro relación entre  Kuwahara (bicicleta de ete ) y Blitz bicicleta de opel .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mVqJ-5D2uU si si ya aparte del reparto equitativo habrá alguien de este planeta que sepa algo mas, los grises son de este planeta? Luego se lo decís a los hombres de negro! pero nada de accidentes , abducciones .. todo de buen rollo y amigos forever .Algo asi como Santa Claus , su trineo y la luna .\n\nEsto del reparto equitativo también sucede con las indemnizaciones de Justicia . Es evidente que el día que solicite un euro con carácter simbólico a Justicia fue debido a que no era momento dado que no estaba el asunto esclarecido , de ahí la demora judicial . Los medicamentos del VIH también se usan para tratar algunos tipos de retraso mental .\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31h_fziiAw Senado Catalán o Senado Alemán con hitler . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRb-env7Dx8&t=1s polvo eres y en polvo te convertirás 999 .   \n\nEn julio de 2021, el mismo Putin dijo en un largo ensayo que rusos y ucranianos eran \""un solo pueblo\"". También señaló que Occidente había corrompido a Ucrania y la había sacado de la órbita de Rusia mediante un \""cambio de identidad forzado\"". https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2022/07/24/por-que-rusia-ucrania-guerra-invasion-motivos-orix/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5xmn4q4JJ8 Jesucristo contra la compañía del taxi.\n\nLos casos de cambio de identidad forzada se dan cuando por ejemplo los padres quieren matar al hijo , pero siempre y cuando el hijo sea hijo real (hijo biológico real) se puede entender que el sistema judicial pretenda mejorar la relación entre familias y no sea necesario el cambio de identidad. También puede darse el caso de hijos biológicos reales que quieran cambiar su nombre al ser producto de una violación en cuyo caso el sistema judicial debería de aceptar el cambio de identidad al ser hijos biológicos por causas de fuerza .También pueda ser que el hijo biológico por causas de fuerza lo sea por motivos económicos como dijo aquella comisaria , en tal caso el sistema judicial no debería aceptar el cambio de identidad por que el motivo del negocio de los hijos forzados sea algo asi como el proces .\n\nPodemos y los intentos de invalidar a la corona .\n\nLa pancorbo trabaja en salud mental y en maternidad , asi que a parte de mover opio , heroína ..(entienda se , de farmacia que sepa ) también tiene que saber que esta pasando en maternidad , don emilio juez del juzgado de instrucción 2 en jaen , lo de amenazas es mentira ya se sabe. Esto pueda ser como el pescador que cree que el pez a mordido el anzuelo y cuando ve el pez resulta que es un tiburón mas grande que la barca.\n\nEl hecho de que esta gente estuviese durante tanto tiempo callada e intentando forzar mi ingreso en una prisión los incrimina directamente , están ocultando muchos delitos si no ya hubiesen hablado y la situación se hubiese solventado antes . \r\nLa persona del servicio de orientación jurídica ( la verdad creo que hace su trabajo) me dijo que me pasara cuando quisiera para cambiar nombre y apellidos por el registro pero intuyo que si hubiese pasado antes se daría por entendido que soy uno de los muchos hijos procedentes de una relación forzosa . La tierra por la que pelean rusos y ucranianos puede ser una nueva andorra .  La gente que trabaja en maternidad tiene que saber lo que ha pasado .\n\na que me puedo pasar por la mansión playboy?\n\nhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/cribeo/20210814/7661973/ministerio-interior-no-reconoce-asociacion-abducidos-alienigenas-espana-pmv.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-N0ABBfIpY planeta de las fiestas ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x3JWWiH6Us  , la estrella de la muerte destruye Scarif https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vYnOcKt7Vo con la banda sonora de de Blade https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d18BDoPcRYo por dj karpin ...y Dios dijo: haga se la luz 999 , eh!

But I need to say it.\n\nNo one deserves to be cancelled here. I've been an ARMY for ages, I've gone to and graduated from college while getting comfort from their music and content, and I get an unbelievable ammount of strength from them touching on topics that I struggle with daily. I've gained something valuable and positive from being in this fandom. But some parts of it will always make you realize why not everyone sees that positivity from the outside.\n\nEvery fandom has their toxic side. EVERY fandom has a portion of it that loves looking for things to be outraged about, and to rage against, and those people tend to also have a more active, vocal presence on social media. It's just that when the fandom is large, so then do the numbers of such people increase. It becomes harder even for people within the same fandom who happen to disagree with them to speak up against such a large disgruntled mob, especially for people who tend to be more passive and stay away from topics like this, instead just waiting for things to blow over.\n\nI understand where the frustration comes from, and where the feeling of \""righteousness\"" comes frombut that doesn't mean they are justified in this case. I've tried reasoning with people on every IG post I find regarding this, and the responses varied a lot as expected, because \""ARMY\"" are just people too; some of them  would delete my comments, some of them blocked me, some of them hadn't even heard of this and were getting distorted 2nd hand information, and they would be open to changing their minds when presented with the actual facts.\n\nBut what I also found was a huge number of ARMYs who disagreed with what the fandom was doing.Their opinions on the matter differed a bit from person to personbut they were all speaking up to condemn this behavior. That made me a little more hopeful. It shouldn't be surprising, because most of the people I know in this fandom DO stand for kindness, understanding, and self-betterment, and this is a fandom that consistently uses its passionate power for great causes around the world rather than rash \""cancellations\"". But sometimes when things get out of hand like this, it can be easy to forget...\n\nHope this whole thing blows over. Hope this show keeps up the amazing work, hope BTS don't suffer too greatly because of this (they really don't deserve it), and hope ARMYs can still proudly refer to themselves as such moving forward. And to the ones who actually built up a lot of anger, frustration and hatred from this situation, I hope you can find a way to work through these feelings as well, I mean this in the least cynical, condescending or sarcastic way possible."",

I’ve encountered with alot of them and legit get a headache every single time just because of their stupidity and toxicity. \n\nThis situation made me realize how scary some people can be. The dedication they had to literally sabotage this mans career is crazy. I love james and watched him even before i knew about BTS.

If the tick now bites a person or another susceptible mammal, it can be transmitted through the tick's saliva.  However, transmission can also occur directly through contact with the blood or meat of sick animals.  The virus can be transmitted from person to person through infected urine, feces, saliva, or infected blood.  Droplet infections or aerosols are also possible.  The more severe the disease, the more viruses are excreted by the patient.  Therefore, nosocomial infections also occur to a notable extent.\n\n The incubation period is usually between one and 13 days.  The symptoms set in suddenly: fever (constant for five to twelve days, biphasic course), chills, irritability, headache, muscle pain and aching limbs.  Upper abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  Facial reddening and edema, conjunctival and throat reddening are typical.\n\n In some of the patients, a hemorrhagic course develops as a complication from the third to fifth day: intestinal bleeding, vomiting of blood (hematemesis), skin bleeding (up to ecchymosis, small-scale bleeding), hemorrhagic diathesis.\n\n The lethality (mortality) depends on the virus strain and is between two and 50 percent.  It is estimated that about every fifth case in the states of the former USSR is accompanied by hemorrhagic symptoms.  The disease can also be symptom-free (inapparent).  Death usually occurs in the second week of the disease, the cause of death is multiple organ failure.\n\n When the flu outbreaks, the number of actual deaths exceeds that expected.  In this way, around 30,000 additional deaths were determined in Germany for the winter season 1995/96 and the number of 29,000 cases for the winter season 2012/2013.  However, since the turn of the millennium there have also been eight winters with no verifiable excess mortality.\n\n Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections can also overlap with influenza waves.  A study from the US suggests that there are significantly more deaths from influenza in this case;  the excess mortality from influenza is three times higher than that from RSV.\n\n Parainfluenza is caused by various human parainfluenza viruses from the Paramyxovirus family (scientifically Paramyxoviridae) (genera Respirovirus and Orthorubulavirus).  The viruses cause flu-like symptoms.  The infection rate in children up to ten years of age is 90%.  The viruses are spread all over the world.  The transmission occurs through droplet infection.\n\n Parainfluenza often leads to a bacterial superinfection.  The course of the infection depends strongly on the disposition, constitution and especially the age of onset.\n\n Measles or morbilli are highly contagious infectious diseases that mainly affect children.  In addition to the typical red patches of skin (measles rash), the disease causes fever and a considerably weakened general condition.  This so-called childhood disease is caused by the measles virus and in some cases can be life-threatening due to severe progress (complications) with pneumonia and brain infections.\n\n The measles virus occurs worldwide, with the incidence of the disease varying greatly.  Local measles epidemics with high disease and mortality rates occur time and again, particularly in developing countries.  Measles is one of the most common infectious diseases there.  The WHO estimates that they caused nearly half of the 1.7 million vaccine-preventable deaths in children in 2000, out of an estimated 30 to 40 million cases that year.  The number of reported illnesses is far below these estimated values \u200b\u200bdue to the high number of unreported cases\n\n Between September 1998 and April 1999, 229 cases of severe febrile encephalitis were officially reported in Malaysia, and shortly after the epidemic began, nine cases were also reported in Singapore.  Symptoms of severe respiratory infection were also reported here.  Mostly men who worked in slaughterhouses were affected;  48% of the sick died.  It was therefore quickly assumed that there was an association with an infection in animals.  At the same time, a mild outbreak of a febrile respiratory tract infection with unknown pathogen was registered in Malaysia in pigs, which was later identified as the same pathogen as in the encephalitis patients.  In order to prevent the further spread of the epidemic in humans, more than a million pigs were culled, which corresponded to about half of the entire Malaysian pig population.\n\n The infection is easily passed on to humans through close contact with pigs.  Workers in slaughterhouses and on pig farms are therefore considered to be a risk group.  Human-to-human transmission is also possible, as almost half of the workers who fell ill in 1998 had infected a family member.  In pigs, the infection manifests as a mild, febrile respiratory infection.  Pig deaths have not been reported.  Once the infection has been overcome, the pigs appear to be immune to renewed infection;  a corresponding vaccine for pigs has meanwhile been developedbut it is not yet produced or approved.\n\n The very likely biological reservoir of the Nipah virus are fruit bats of the genus Pteropus.  After only serological evidence was found at first, the pathogen could be detected directly in the urine of a flying fox of the species Pteropus lylei in Thailand in 2007.  The infection of the pigs probably originates from these flying foxes through a transmission path which has not yet been fully clarified.  There is evidence that humans can become infected with their saliva and urine through contact with the fruit bats.  Fruits eaten by bats, which in turn are consumed by mammals or humans, pose a high risk of infection.\n\n The disease in humans begins after an incubation period of less than two weeks with acute encephalitis with fever, headache and dizziness.  In 75% of patients, abnormal findings of viral infection in the cerebrospinal fluid appear early.  Patients become comatose within 24 to 48 hours.  Depending on the outbreak, around 40 to 75% of the diseases described so far were fatal.  The administration of ribavirin reduced the mortality to 36%.  In addition to the acute illness, there is also a recurrence of encephalitis in 7.5% of patients, and focal encephalitis only after months in those infected with no symptoms (3.4%).  The time span between acute illness and late complication (relapse) averages 8.4 months.  Permanent damage such as chronic seizure disorders (epilepsy) and personality changes after surviving infection are described.\n\n HCoV-NL63 has its origins in coronaviruses from infected musangs and bats.  HCoV-NL63 is one of seven known representatives of the Coronaviridae that infect humans, including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, the original SARS-CoV (i.e. SARS-CoV-1)  and SARS-CoV-2.  It is estimated that the last common ancestor with HCoV-229E existed about 1000 years ago;  it has probably been circulating in humans for centuries.,\n\n HCoV-NL63 is believed to spread through direct person-to-person transmission in densely populated areas.  The virus particles can survive outside the human body in aqueous solutions at room temperature for up to a week and on dry surfaces for up to three hours.  Most people will contract a coronavirus at some point in their lifebut some segments of the population are more prone to HCoV-NL63.  These include children under the age of 5, the elderly, and the immunocompromised.  HCoV-NL63 appears to have a seasonal preference; in temperate climates it is most common in the winter months.  In more extreme and tropical climates, the virus has no preference for a particular time of year.  Many studies have reported the coexistence of HCoV-NL63 with other human coronaviruses, influenza A viruses, human orthopneumoviruses (human respiratory syncytial virus, hRSV), parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumoviruses (hMPV)."",

These include children under the age of 5, the elderly, and the immunocompromised.  HCoV-NL63 appears to have a seasonal preference; in temperate climates it is most common in the winter months.  In more extreme and tropical climates, the virus has no preference for a particular time of year.  Many studies have reported the coexistence of HCoV-NL63 with other human coronaviruses, influenza A viruses, human orthopneumoviruses (human respiratory syncytial virus, hRSV), parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumoviruses (hMPV)."",

The end of a phase doesn't mean that everybody will just stop listening to them or forget about them, it means that the fans won't be as obsessed wit them as they are now, especially if they're in their teenage years. I know that generations will pass out their music like the examples you mentioned: Madonna, The Beatles, Michael Jackson etc. But they won't be as popular because music is something that changes as time goes by or is it that you hear a Madonna song every single day in the radio? No. Why? Because her fans grew out of their phase with her. Doesn't mean that she's forgotten, she's just not in trend anymore. \nHey, if you don't like The Beatles because of their music style I SHOULD RESPECT THAT.  I'm pretty sure i made that clear before but here it goes again \n*MUSIC TASTE IS DIFFERENT FROM PERSON TO PERSON.*\nI'm not assuming anything about bts. I know their songs are different I JUST DON'T LIKE THEM. I didn't want to say it like that because its mean but looks like you want to force me into liking them and its really annoying.\n\nI'm sorrybut for the way you're insisting I'm not listening to the songs you send.  You represent the band terribly. \n\nListen, if you don't like one direction, I DON'T MIND. Because music is something you should enjoy, not be forced into, I feel sorry you're not capable of understanding that.\nAnd stop saying \""don't judge\"" and \""don't assume\"" when you are judging me for not liking them, and assuming i live in ignorance. Check yourself first.\nBecause i know that you'll answer with an even longer comment, I'm saying goodbye, I'm done with this argument.

I'm pretty sure i made that clear before but here it goes again \n*MUSIC TASTE IS DIFFERENT FROM PERSON TO PERSON.*\nI'm not assuming anything about bts. I know their songs are different I JUST DON'T LIKE THEM. I didn't want to say it like that because its mean but looks like you want to force me into liking them and its really annoying.\n\nI'm sorrybut for the way you're insisting I'm not listening to the songs you send.  You represent the band terribly. \n\nListen, if you don't like one direction, I DON'T MIND. Because music is something you should enjoy, not be forced into, I feel sorry you're not capable of understanding that.\nAnd stop saying \""don't judge\"" and \""don't assume\"" when you are judging me for not liking them, and assuming i live in ignorance. Check yourself first.\nBecause i know that you'll answer with an even longer comment, I'm saying goodbye, I'm done with this argument. You can go back to my other comments and read them again since you completely misinterpreted them the first time."",

              ""textDisplay"": ""@Rebecka Poli.  First, I appreciate your reply and sorry if my reply comes off as salty but I wanted to clarify to you about differences between the two as you said you have no clue about BTS.  First you talk about phases that will end for boyband (or any band). In general, it’s true that there will be phases but do you see those phases that stop for The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Madonna, Michael Jackson?  They have new generations of fans passed down by parents and others of older generations. The only phase that past for those fans is when they die and that is how I see BTS fans are similar.   People of all ages discover BTS music every day become new fans and I don’t see them ever phasing out.  Unfortunately, 1D can only rely on those fans that follow them from the time they were together to support their music but you don’t see a new growing fan base for them.\n\n And how is it possible you say that you have no clue about BTS’s music and at the same time not like their music when you either heard a song or never before?   It’s like you are saying you hear one of their songs you don’t like and you label that one sound as BTS music.  It’s like me saying I don’t like the Beatles classic song “Twist and Shout” because their sound is just rock and rollbut the Beatles are pioneers of experimental sounds in the 60s and that classical songs that are loved like “Eleanor Rigby” or “The Long and Winding Road” or “Revolution” would not be heard by you because you didn’t like “Twist and Shout”   You assumed all their songs sound are rock and roll music you don’t like and so different sounding songs.  If you like “Yellow Submarine”, you would miss out on “Hey Jude” because the songs sound completely different.  \n\nOf course music taste is different but did you know some of their older songs sound similar to 1D so you judge something you hear on Carpool karaoke and you think that is always how BTS music sounds like thatbut I told you in my last reply the genre of BTS’s music is very diverse they don’t have one sound.  They are so diverse that even few older songs of BTS sounds like 1D or other typical boy bands.  I sent you a few songs so you can hear for yourself.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wn85Ge22FQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcKkcyS410\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDQ5-lXb3UI\n\nIf you play me any music from any album of 1D and I can tell you that music is the sound of 1D music but you can’t put BTS music in one category.  So I get bored with 1D when most songs are about sad song breakups and musically similar to many songs album to album.  I’ve sampled enough of their music that I might like a catchy song here or there but I always end up with feeling nothing new or groundbreaking about their music.  Even their solo careers music sound as if they are still in 1D.  Only Zayn Malik is different from 1D sound because his genre is r&b soul. BTS’s music is not the same so you would not know it was BTS from first listen because they constantly change their sound since they have directions with their musical concepts from album to album.  I can see you like BTS personalities but you shouldn’t dislike BTS music simply because you never really heard their music before."",

Besides tacitly condoning mafioso type forms of widespread but localized neighborhood “management” with trickle up economics being the name of the game, or stylish cars, boutique clothes, sultry women, building a tower that ends up becoming a huge attraction because of an error in calculations regarding stability tolerances and bad luck in that they were shown why there are stability tolerances, then good luck, that it has defied said tolerances to remain erect for several centuries, or for having a  globally recognizable by any conscious human geographical shape closely resembling an article of attire for which there is no mistaking?     What about complexion, bioaromatic tropes, and being romantic and passionate?     All of that is funny, depending on who you are?  All of that is offensive, depending on who you are.   And yet, the grey area of racial sensitivities has taken a jagged edge to and fro, ebbing and flowing, where historical atrocities and accomplishments might be either celebrated or regretted.    One day, sooner than later, we all, the whole human race, will look back and realize what an atrocity the last 150 years of fossil fuel consuming has been.   With full disclosure I must expose the fact that I’ve never owned an non-V-8 powered automobile, and I’m a devoted gear head and hell raising consumer if said fossil fuels.    But we could have done these things without doing so much shitting where we eat.    There are arguments against this.    They are pathetically narrow of scope.    The biggest loads of mass carried across land around the world are drawn forward by a hybrid propulsion system, no so different from a Prius.  And they have been that way for several decades.    If a similar amount of effort had been put into electrical conveyance, we could have ended fossil fuel consumption by 90% 100 years ago.    You know at least five people whose lives have been negatively altered by fossil fuel consumption to this degree we use now.    Air pollution is responsible for at least one life a year.   I use that number because we put so much effort into saving each and every person’s life.  Until that life begins to be compared with monetary worth.    Here’s an excellent example of my point.   If Ronald Reagan, for the pin y of this story being a highly revered public figure known around the world first as an actor and then leader of the free world, had lived in the country before moving an urban center, and then in an alarmingly short period of time to become sick, and taking a long time to recover, and then discovering he had a disease, whether a cardiovascular condition or cancer or whatever, never previously observed to advance so quickly or maybe even not really known aboutbut was overwhelmingly attributable to the air he was breathing in the “big city”, scaring the population into parking their cars and disavowing trucks blowing black smoke all over the place, and other known pollutants, factories, etc.    Why?   Because it happened to someone that most people would consider EXTRA valuable.    The prez of America.    And seeing as how he has an appointed physician keeping a close eye on his health, the documentation would be unique compared to the medical histories of ordinary citizens.   Leaving the evidence indisputable.    I once was tasked with sorting x-rays of mesothelioma cases by the thousands.     THAT’S evidence.   It changed the world of asbestos use.    And becoming sick from airborne pollutants of petroleum origins in ANY amount of time is unacceptable.  In a short amount of time is simply alarming.    Let’s just say that what happens to the president in my example happens all over the world routinely.   And it does.   But the empirical evidence is rarely compiled in such a way as to unequivocally prove causation so directly.    And even if it was, anyone who knew of its existence with any wealth interest in the causation itself would make it go bye-bye.     We knew slavery was an evil the whole time we practiced it.    We CHOSE not to see it to the point that it became NORMAL.   If you could get in the headspace of people of those times, it simply was not viewed as horrific as it is today.    If you Jill someone there’s no escaping the realities of something like that.   At some points in history, women couldn’t vote, black people weren’t free, and people threw plastic and paper and glass in the trash and thought nothing of dumping hazardous waste right into the street, or worse yet, right into the waterways that fed the local population, and certain commonly used compounds were not seen as dangerous.    Lead used to be the main component of Roman dishes and vessels, and more so by the wealthy, with a clear association shown between madness and disease afflicting a much higher proportion of those wealthy later to be found to be attributable to their close contact and exposure to lead.   Point is that no one thought anything of it.   And no one thought anything of Corbett’s satire.  Or did they?   My overall point is that people need to have some perspective about what’s important in our culture, and when they see that so much energy is wasted whining about whips and chains and rape and slaughter and subjugation and incarceration and sickening habitats in which they are trapped, by design, then the beatings can begin to stop.    See what I did there?\u003cbr\u003e  That’s humor.    Whining about being whipped being compared to whining about someone dancing in a matter roughly representative of your culture is outrageous, played off as nonchalant.  The definition of humor.  On the other hand, if you are offended by racial epithets, then that means by definition that you recognized the example portrayed, which means it has some real place in reality, which means that the ACTUAL is being poked at as funny so that more of us can laugh.    It’s not funny to mock anyone or anything under certain circumstances.   But it’s also not necessary to take every mockery and claim it as your own personal or your own cultural subject which you proclaim off-limits.    I mean, let’s depict masses of bearded and large nosed robe wearers stepping of a high cliff.    Or a ship packed “like sardines” full of black people with a sardine packed between THEM lamenting, “you should feel lucky.  At least you’re not a sardine.”    Cause that’s funny.     How about a white boy, like me, claiming to understand the generational damage done to entire cultures by would-be oppressors bent on subjugating other humans into lifelong bondage?   That’s outrageous because how could I know anything about being whipped and my mother being routinely raped by a far white asshole?   That’s funny though.  Because it’s being played as a lesson and satire.  Or was it just claimed as that AFTER some whimps started whining about being sleeping on dirt and being fed the most atrocious food imaginable.

To spite what Brooke says there is usually a ring of truth to it..she was on target about Thomas Quinn the territorial wet alley cat and her BFF .Ridge neglected Brooke for months and turned on her upon finding out about a simple kiss due to her vulnerability of battling with her own husband who never had any faith in her because he doesn't trust Brooke anymore than he trust himself ...Brooke forgave him after he thought he married Shauna.. Brooke doesnt love Deacon..and in time all that. Scramble up shat will become unravel. So enjoy it while U can .Syiffy ho and her brother R wasting there time. Brooke and Ridge always prevail.. I read where R. J..is coming back and Rick to offset there plans .but I hope that all this scramble up crap Sheila orchestrated rids Brooke of the whiney entitled Ridge Forester and maybe the feud will finally end and Stuffy ho can finally relax and become a woman of substance with high morals .I think its her mindset to be miserable and ungrateful.  She proved that when she put Finn on the back burner until Liam went back to Hope once again ..give it up....let it go....bla bla bla bla bla bla says the teacher to the blockhead Charlie Brown. .LM done.."",

They need a movie together with the rock and mark Wahlberg as well! I pray that all who may see this no matter what age gender race etc know that You are beautiful just as you are. If you/we ever forget I pray we allow God to remind us! You’re beautifully fearfully and wonderfully Hand made and crafted by God the Creator of all no matter what. As are they. As is everyone! Also know the Creator of All of the Universe the ENTIRE UNIVERSE who Created YOU!/Us loves us more than any other creation He created though we don’t deserve it. Isn’t that amazing? I pray if anyone may not know Jesus that you/they may come to. You’ll never regret it. Our relationship with Him is soooo personal. He loves us so much it’s amazing. It touches me to know I’m NEVER alone. He will NEVER leave nor forsake me. I can feel Him with me always. His love is contagious and I can feel it radiate through my bones and warm/wake my soul. Thank You God! I pray you may feel that too it’s free for the taking. It’s so simple to get. He loves you already so much He just wants us to accept Him so we can spend Eternity with Him and He can give us the life He knows we’d best fit and love and He can use us. Our sense of purpose validation hope joy peace and Salvation is Anchored in Him. Jesus is coming back soon and I pray as many as possible are willing may return to Heaven with Him. I’m thankful to know where I’m going! I mean this to let you know you’re loved no matter what! He is there for you. With you. Never going to leave you. He has His hand reached out to you ready to bring you in His arms. No matter what we may have done in the past present or future. He loves. He forgives. He mends broken Hearts. He saved. He’s the only person you can trust your heart and soul with. God bless you is my prayer. Your life is needed. You matter. God proves that. He reminds us of that daily. You have worth and purpose in Him. You’re valid as are your thoughts and feelings. It’s okay not to be okay. God helps us. He gives us recourses we may need. He is with us always. For eternity if we accept and choose Him. He has gifts He wants us to use or He wants to give us. He protects our Souls and Hearts. He corrects us in loving ways and wants nothing but the best for us He helps us through this scary world. He hung on The Cross for hours in so much pain. (Trigger warning about being beaten) Tendons showing bones out horrible pain.  He didn’t die because His body couldn’t take anymore He died because He decided when to give up the Ghost. He took the keys to Hell. He resurrected. On the Cross He said to God when they were doing such horrible things “Father they know NOT what they do” He took up for us. People often don’t know what to say when they pray. It doesn’t matter. Jesus translates/intercedes on our behalf to God. Jesus can take your emotions and translate them to God. Just pray to Jesus like when you’re talking to a friend. It doesn’t have to be proper or some by the book prayer. Jesus chose to die for us. A horrible death. He payed the price for our sins. He bought us. But He gives us free Will whether or not to choose Him. Anyone who goes to Hell is a stranger there. Hell is not meant for us. God gives us a choice. “If God loves us then why is hell an option or why do bad things happen” you might ask the answer is when Adam and Eve sinned in the Garden we then became sinners. We sin each day without knowing. We do bad things think bad things and that’s human. But God forgives us and loves us and says we don’t have to go to hell. We aren’t meant to. Sin is sin. There is no less bad or worse sin. It’s all horrible. But Jesus loves us anyways. When we go off and get in a hole of sin (even as saved Christians we still sin) He rescues us. He forgives us. That’s not an excuse to do it but it shows His love for us. Bad things happen on this earth because of the devil. Not because of God. “Why doesn’t he stop the devil” you might ask He promises to defeat the devil. The Victory is Won. If you know Jesus you’re on the Winning side. The devil is the god of this earth. But God has already defeated Him. Other peoples horrible actions and sins can bleed over into our lives causing bad things to happen. God doesn’t want that. I don’t know all the answers. God does. If you want to more I urge you to find out. My favorite Bible I’ve ever owned is a KJV life application Bible please read it for yourself. No matter what. Life application study Bibles break verses down so you can understand them. They are great. Thank You God! Have a great day today and tomorrow. Be safe! I hope 2022 so far has been a great year for you if not I hope the rest is. I hope the rest is anyway lol!  I hope the rest of your life is wonderful as well!  I pray your family, friends, loved ones, and most importantly yourself are all wrapped in a hedge of protection from any and all illnesses whether they be mental or physical. Including I pray God touches your life and gives you peace and strength. I pray your life is filled with happiness, success, love, peace, and joy. Have a great rest of your year. I hope you had of had a great year so far. I pray you have a great day/night. I pray God may use you and touch you. I hope y’all have a great day tomorrow! Spread love, peace, and kindness whenever you can. If you are ever going through a difficult time know that it is temporary and God is always there. If you need to talk about anything once again God is always there and feel free to talk to me bc we can talk about it if you need. I mean none of this by harm. I simply wish to bring joy to your life and a smile to your face. Know YOU ARE LOVED. If not by many you’re loved by Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. You’re loved by me although I may talk to you as much as I should or I’d like to. I pray you know you’re special, loved, worthy and KNOW you matter. God wouldn’t have created us if we all didn’t matter and have a purpose. He thinks of us constantly. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. I pray you have a GREAT rest of your evening, day, week, month, year, and  life. I am praying for you. Remember this is a safe space. \u003ca href=\""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23jesussavesandlovesall\""\u003e#JesusSavesAndLovesAll\u003c/a\u003e🙌❤️😭😁🙌 Thank You Lord! I know this is a lot but God put it on my heart to say some things. Thank You God for the love and feeling of the Holy Spirit. I pray you may know Him too. God bless you all. Jesus loves you infinitely He loves you more than anything else can because He loves us so much and He loves us more than anything else that exists. I love my Mom whole heartedly. Jesus loves her even more. Thank You God. I pray you may love Jesus feel His love on you. Love yourself through Him find in Him your worth validation happiness joy peace help hope most of all Salvation (with Salvation the others tend to follow even in the hard times) (please listen to “God on the mountain” by the gathers and “you’re not in this alone” by the Browders)  and I pray we all may love others through Him because He first loved us. He still does. He always will. No matter the pain you’ve gone through in your past He loves you. In Heaven there will be no pain! With Him we have peace. My mom sings a song that goes “Victory is mine God told Satan to get thee behind Victory today is mine Joy is mine Peace is mine Joy today is mine God told Satan to get thee behind Joy today is mine Salvation is mine Salvation is mine Salvation today is mine Love is mine love is mine happiness is mine happiness is mine GOD TOLD SATAN TO GET THEE BEHIND VICTORY TODAY IS MINE! Etc etc! “ Luke 4:8 “ And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.” KJV even Jesus was tempted/bothered by Satan never be afraid to rebuke. God bless you all. Jesus loves and ADORES YOU He died for you. He saves!"",

I hope 2022 so far has been a great year for you if not I hope the rest is. I hope the rest is anyway lol!  I hope the rest of your life is wonderful as well!  I pray your family, friends, loved ones, and most importantly yourself are all wrapped in a hedge of protection from any and all illnesses whether they be mental or physical. Including I pray God touches your life and gives you peace and strength. I pray your life is filled with happiness, success, love, peace, and joy. Have a great rest of your year. I hope you had of had a great year so far. I pray you have a great day/night. I pray God may use you and touch you. I hope y’all have a great day tomorrow! Spread love, peace, and kindness whenever you can. If you are ever going through a difficult time know that it is temporary and God is always there. If you need to talk about anything once again God is always there and feel free to talk to me bc we can talk about it if you need. I mean none of this by harm. I simply wish to bring joy to your life and a smile to your face. Know YOU ARE LOVED. If not by many you’re loved by Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. You’re loved by me although I may talk to you as much as I should or I’d like to. I pray you know you’re special, loved, worthy and KNOW you matter. God wouldn’t have created us if we all didn’t matter and have a purpose. He thinks of us constantly. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. I pray you have a GREAT rest of your evening, day, week, month, year, and  life. I am praying for you. Remember this is a safe space. #JesusSavesAndLovesAll🙌❤️😭😁🙌 Thank You Lord!

He still does. He always will. No matter the pain you’ve gone through in your past He loves you. In Heaven there will be no pain! With Him we have peace. My mom sings a song that goes “Victory is mine God told Satan to get thee behind Victory today is mine Joy is mine Peace is mine Joy today is mine God told Satan to get thee behind Joy today is mine Salvation is mine Salvation is mine Salvation today is mine Love is mine love is mine happiness is mine happiness is mine GOD TOLD SATAN TO GET THEE BEHIND VICTORY TODAY IS MINE!

Her accomplice is Mark Lau, MD, one of her men for Gloria to be Agripina Ferrer someday. Gloria also shot Ai Imanil, the growing beautiful daughter of Jonathan Imanil in HI in payment of my airline travel from Boston to Guam in 2018.

Lorrin Lau) and Calimlim have heist of Laca Imanil--generations of Norma Laca and Orlando Ferrer Imanil in GU and HI. Gloria deletes our names at airbase of Hickam and AAFB to ensure Gloria and her generations are Imanil (sky) and that is her greatest obsession when she tried to travel 1st class free of charge as Irene Imanil or Norma Imanil. Laca is also Gloria&#39;s fight with me and Norma Laca because she&#39;s out of Laca Imanil bloodlinebut she wants her sons and daughters to be Laca Imanil. Gloria called Norma Laca inutil. Gloria spit on Norma and punched her. Gloria spreads rumor that she&#39;s the operative of government to kill us that is why I am seeking for asylum to ensure our long term survival. Gloria&#39;s network and/or Gloria could give instructions to EMT for my, my brother&#39;s capture, my brother&#39;s sons and daughters capture because we&#39;re not militarily active at Hickam. We need protection from Calimlim, Lau heist of death in HI. Command Hickam to house us under one roof with guns for our protection and defense. Gloria&#39;s belief that my being on EBT is ground for kokua, and other adverse healthcare practices. If not my brother Jonathan and his sons and daughters are going to pay for my water consumption, food consumption that retarded Gloria believes belongs to her as fake Irene Imanil who stole and use my name. The adverse effect of wiretapping enables Gloria to see me, my brother, his sons and daughters, and those he cared for, and device plans to get us euthanized at the hospitals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGet Gloria killed despite her beauty so healthcare practice will go away. Get also Madeleine Z. Bordallo killed who refused to fund Rothchild and me. She got a hold of Orly and Jonathan and used them to withdraw money from the banksbut she told lies to them that she gave Norma little $ and cell/mobile phone, yet she did not. She controls GU and HI real estate. She complains she couldn&#39;t do anything because her network of Asians don&#39;t want her to do anything to keep us funded and alive, yet she has the command of airbases. Temporary close airbases especially overseas until I am militarily activated. Find out who from among the congress men and women submitted documents for our destruction and death in America. I want to be counted as American from America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGloria won&#39;t stop her euthanasia effort to prove she&#39;s King Philip, II yet it is me who&#39;s blotted King Philip, II. Gloria lost her being human by her effort to euthanize even someone as young as 10 year old. She conforms her lips with mine. She shot Ai Imanil and other school aged children. Think about a human being who wants to scape death from the hands of Gloria who&#39;s in the hospital rooms of latched doors, hospital rooms with anesthesia and guns, hospital rooms with computers to and for wiretap. What is the human being going to do? Wait to die or kill Gloria? How can one kill Gloria when she enters a room with latched door and watched the father someone trying to save his son or daughter from Gloria&#39;s hand? She has grievance of me because I caused her to fall in Kahala of fairly good lifestyle, so she&#39;s out to get me, my brother in HI and their sons and daughters, and all men who became Jonathan Imanil.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReal estate in HI are up for grab by non Imanil who are for the most part foreigners and Hickam airmen, leaving me homeless in the streets. Realtors changed door knobs and door locks without giving me keys. I thought we&#39;ve gone through 9/11 to reset  my inclusion. Mark Lau took so long to help us. Does that suggest that he wants us to die? that is why I&#39;m getting him killed before he strikes us with ambulance capture, hospital confinement, and death through starvation and euthanasia. He&#39;s someone I knew from time past--from hospitalization at Queens for open heart surgerybut since he sired Gloria Casupang Calimlim children, he&#39;s become a total liar over who is Gloria Calimlim, that according to him she&#39;s my daughter, that Gloria was born in the Philippines. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGo to Mr. XiJinPing of China and explain to him why I&#39;m getting Mark Lau killed, so he knows the facts because Gloria shows off that their blotted in China. The problem is Madeleine Z. Bordallo will tell lies to Asian countries that I&#39;m getting Asian killed, yet it is not true. The truth is I&#39;m getting MZB killed for her heist of not only Norma Lacabut her block and heist of me since 1981. Will MZB tell you the truth when you inquire about my father&#39;s situation in GU? She&#39;ll tell you lie or complain that she assigned you Orlando Ferrer Imanil. Did she assign Vladimir Putin of Russia Orlando Ferrer Imanil or Orly Laca Imanil? MZB&#39;s AAFB holo is the worst. She kills a human being indirectly through command with the military and INC network. She commands her network in GU to carry out the killing. She&#39;d reason she&#39;s not in GU when killing took placebut she already gave command and then she left the island to ensure she had nothing to do, yet she&#39;s the planner and commander of that death.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith MS in Pharmacology, I am on EBT with tracking for 60 days. Inquire what are these in HI. The State Department should do its through investigations of HI&#39;s healthcare as quid pro quo for someone on welfare--EBT and section 8. Why am I excluded? The State of HI doesn&#39;t count me unless I am militarily activated at Hickambut the commander there won&#39;t move to get me activated; instead she used my name to sit there and plan for my ambulance capture and/or cops capture without crime committedbut being on EBT, and use of public restroom? What&#39;s going on? My brother Jonathan was pushed out of Waikiki. Investigate who has done it and get them killed. Is Bangcag dead or alive? He&#39;s a cute little lad holding a dog. Why MZB didn&#39;t secure the son of Norma Laca in HI whose name is Jonathan Imanil. So what&#39;s her reasoning in tagalog &quot;Nakalimutan kulang nee&quot; Why does she speak in tagalog? Who are her audience trying to please with her tagalog speaking ability? I heard she did heinous crime in Germany when Ms. Merkel is asking for Rothchild. Prostitution and murder of Asians is one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith you, I&#39;ll take MZB&#39;s place. Countries of world have been asking for my parents and now mebut why am I block after block. Who from congress, and oval office, (America) filed paper to block, oppressed, and suppressed us in America? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven House of Windsor and Buckingham Palace is waiting for me. I&#39;m sure heritage of King Philip there want to ask me questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsian countries gave a lot too for our survival. Their sin is manufacturing of little $ blotter and shipped them to America. Why little $? I&#39;m penniless in America? Who&#39;s using the most of China made little $ blottler? Why Norma Laca is poor in America? Why am I poor in America? Is MZB going by Norma, Orlando, Irene, Orly, Jonathan, Myra? Why she won&#39;t talk to us, much less give us a dime? She held our names hostage and used it to fundraise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKing Philip, II"",

Gloria lost her being human by her effort to euthanize even someone as young as 10 year old. She conforms her lips with mine. She shot Ai Imanil and other school aged children. Think about a human being who wants to scape death from the hands of Gloria who's in the hospital rooms of latched doors, hospital rooms with anesthesia and guns, hospital rooms with computers to and for wiretap. What is the human being going to do? Wait to die or kill Gloria? How can one kill Gloria when she enters a room with latched door and watched the father someone trying to save his son or daughter from Gloria's hand? She has grievance of me because I caused her to fall in Kahala of fairly good lifestyle, so she's out to get me, my brother in HI and their sons and daughters, and all men who became Jonathan Imanil.\n\nReal estate in HI are up for grab by non Imanil who are for the most part foreigners and Hickam airmen, leaving me homeless in the streets. Realtors changed door knobs and door locks without giving me keys. I thought we've gone through 9/11 to reset  my inclusion. Mark Lau took so long to help us. Does that suggest that he wants us to die? that is why I'm getting him killed before he strikes us with ambulance capture, hospital confinement, and death through starvation and euthanasia. He's someone I knew from time past--from hospitalization at Queens for open heart surgerybut since he sired Gloria Casupang Calimlim children, he's become a total liar over who is Gloria Calimlim, that according to him she's my daughter, that Gloria was born in the Philippines. \n\nGo to Mr. XiJinPing of China and explain to him why I'm getting Mark Lau killed, so he knows the facts because Gloria shows off that their blotted in China. The problem is Madeleine Z. Bordallo will tell lies to Asian countries that I'm getting Asian killed, yet it is not true. The truth is I'm getting MZB killed for her heist of not only Norma Lacabut her block and heist of me since 1981. Will MZB tell you the truth when you inquire about my father's situation in GU? She'll tell you lie or complain that she assigned you Orlando Ferrer Imanil. Did she assign Vladimir Putin of Russia Orlando Ferrer Imanil or Orly Laca Imanil? MZB's AAFB holo is the worst. She kills a human being indirectly through command with the military and INC network. She commands her network in GU to carry out the killing. She'd reason she's not in GU when killing took placebut she already gave command and then she left the island to ensure she had nothing to do, yet she's the planner and commander of that death.\n\nWith MS in Pharmacology, I am on EBT with tracking for 60 days. Inquire what are these in HI. The State Department should do its through investigations of HI's healthcare as quid pro quo for someone on welfare--EBT and section 8. Why am I excluded? The State of HI doesn't count me unless I am militarily activated at Hickambut the commander there won't move to get me activated; instead she used my name to sit there and plan for my ambulance capture and/or cops capture without crime committedbut being on EBT, and use of public restroom? What's going on? My brother Jonathan was pushed out of Waikiki. Investigate who has done it and get them killed. Is Bangcag dead or alive? He's a cute little lad holding a dog. Why MZB didn't secure the son of Norma Laca in HI whose name is Jonathan Imanil. So what's her reasoning in tagalog \""Nakalimutan kulang nee\"" Why does she speak in tagalog? Who are her audience trying to please with her tagalog speaking ability? I heard she did heinous crime in Germany when Ms. Merkel is asking for Rothchild. Prostitution and murder of Asians is one.\n\nWith you, I'll take MZB's place. Countries of world have been asking for my parents and now mebut why am I block after block. Who from congress, and oval office, (America) filed paper to block, oppressed, and suppressed us in America? \n\nEven House of Windsor and Buckingham Palace is waiting for me. I'm sure heritage of King Philip there want to ask me questions.\n\nAsian countries gave a lot too for our survival. Their sin is manufacturing of little $ blotter and shipped them to America. Why little $? I'm penniless in America? Who's using the most of China made little $ blottler? Why Norma Laca is poor in America? Why am I poor in America? Is MZB going by Norma, Orlando, Irene, Orly, Jonathan, Myra? Why she won't talk to us, much less give us a dime? She held our names hostage and used it to fundraise.\n\nKing Philip, II"",

Shine a 390 nanometer light(black light) through a one inch hole in the top of a large cardboard box filled with outside air, and sitting on the ground to see what is being sprayed on you! Post it!  Comments are being suppressed, to cover up a genocide happening like during WW2, news media no commenting =propaganda, which can&#39;t stand scrutiny.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic and now under a corona virus /monkey pox pandemic.  It is not Russia or China spraying American skies in parallel lines.  It is not China or Russia venting gases to take your breath away in your dwellings.  You need a radiation detector and an air quality monitor with logging.  It usually happens at night while you sleep and you probably don&#39;t even know.  Vaccines(Computer vaccines) hide information from you.  When you think that they are talking about real viruses, they are actually taking about electronic generated information that they must suppress by forcing a computer anti virus signature that looks for information and deletes it from your view. NATO is the military arm of Revelation17,18, and is about to start a war with China, saying they attacked Taiwan.  Taiwan until very recently was acknowledged by the majority of all nations of the world as being part of China.  Taiwan has no embassy, as they are not a Country.  It was just recently changed on US documents in order to start the coming war.  The US has just passed a law similar to the one during WW2, to supply endless weapons to Taiwan.  WW2 China was attacked from Taiwan after it&#39;s invasion by Japan.  Donald Trump told 3.5years in advance how the US would soon be waging war with Russia and China.  This is all staged by Rome.  The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State of Rome Italy.  He rules over the soon to be ten Nations of the Roman Empire.  The Country is the smallest in the world, and has its own flag and representatives in the UN, and other political bodies.  The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Churchbut also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms.  Empires in the Bible are referred to as beasts, and Rome&#39;s image to represent it is the cross or X, which symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,&quot;get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her&quot;. Revelation 18:4 Get out of her &quot;MY PEOPLE!&quot;  Ukraine killed NAZI Pow&#39;s because they were talking.  Revealing their NAZI affiliations.  The Red Cross is part of the Roman system masquerading as an aid organizationbut is military intelligence.  It has the (M.O.B.) mark of the beast as it&#39;s emblem.   Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a Western backed coup in 2014, which forensic evidence told a different story than video evidence, so there was  a conspiracy.  Western media changed the name of the Ukraine Capital from a Russian name to some thing else.  The Russian language, history and culture were hidden and suppressed.  Those with out blue arm bands would be put to death by Ukrainian forces run by foreigners.  Zellensky says that Ukraine will become a Catholic State under the Pope, and that is why Roman Catholics Nancy Palosi and Joe Biden are supporting the war against Ukraine and Russia.  Imagine Germany flying in to PEI(Prince Edward Island) Canada against Canada&#39;s wishes and saying they will supply them with unlimited arms to fight Canada.  Eighty five percent of the people of PEI don&#39;t want to separate.  Then Germany says that Canada is flying over PEI&#39;s air space, and makes the world think that Canada is violating PEI. Germany sends military jets of theirs and Japan&#39;s to escort a woman to PEI to stir this up, a long with 5 aircraft carrier battle groups. Imagine that!  Or what if this happened to Alaska?  Well this is happeningbut not to PEIbut to Taiwan and China.  Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Countrybut part of Canada.  It was not Germanybut backed by NATO.  The Pope&#39;s terror squad. The US and Japan are militarizing an Island near Taiwanbut NATO said they would attack the Soloman Islands if they militarize.(not if they attack, just militarizing) These wars are to hide Revelation 17,18&#39;s identity, and to distract you from the 1918/WW2 like genocide.  Comments are being edited by G7 Nations.(security reasons). Truth can stand on it&#39;s own two feetbut lies have to be propped up. Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023 Executive Order 14067 sec#4 to control buying and selling.  WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a &quot;temporary&quot; measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it&#39;s use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. 85% of Taiwanese want to remain a part of Chinabut that does not stop Rome from fomenting an other war to distract people from it being publicly exposed as fraud.  All the fraudulent leaders must keep Rome propped up to keep their own deceptive systems a float. In the West, there is a lot of corrupt media pretending that Taiwan is it&#39;s own Country and China wants to absorb it. Religious people say follow Godbut in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth.  God tells you there, what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  People are following Satan as if God.  Why tax exempt(Cowardly officials) The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new name =different avenue of attack.   A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  *One\u003c/b\u003e is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  \u003cb\u003eTwo\u003c/b\u003e the second is a so called virus that attacks humans with signs of sneezing, head pain and breathlessness, like when a person is radiated or gassed. Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing them to sneeze and eventually die(zyklon b, causing suffocation).  Look in to the sky and you will see planes spraying the sky in parallel patterns, just before an outbreak. Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  Man can live for everbut it is being hide from you, by people who want to dominate and suppress you.  There are already technologies to heat and power cars and houses with out requiring any fuel. You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. \u003cbr\u003eTechnology is  being exploited to do things that are not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech because it is doing some thing it is not supposed to.  The government forces technogy to be breached by law enforcement, and then exploited for evil ends.  Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  They are trying to shut down microprocessor production.  Why did Nancy Pelosi by military escort breach a sovereign Nation&#39;s land where the microprocessor&#39;s are made?  Think!  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire.  Look at early 15th century Magna Carta documents where it talks how Rome will pay back for the wholesale slaughter of populations.  It says to lock them down then go in and exterminate.  \u200bIt was done under the guise of a typhus epidemic by Austrian/German Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler during WW2, and now they are doing it under a corona virus pandemic/ monkey pox pandemic. On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Russia built and controls the nuclear power plant and would not bomb themselves. Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. Gog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars. Scott Ritter confirms US and UK committing war crimes in Ukraine.  Are NATO forces going to attack China from an Island near Taiwan?  Joe Biden building a government army 86000 people willing to use deadly force against Americans. !(!(((("",

              ""textDisplay"": ""@Neuro Demonio Que trates de hacerme quedar de ignorante mostrando superioridad moral lo que denota es clara falta de seguridad en tu propio coeficiente intelectual, porque para tener que llamar tontos a los demás es que no sabes valorarte por tí mismo. No soy fan de Chanel, de hecho yo siempre fui con Rigo y Tanxugueiras (aunque admiro su actuación) de modo que no aplaudiría lo que dijera en cualquier caso. Aplaudo que se hable de sexo con naturalidad, creo que es muy necesario. Las niñas no van a querer automáticamente tener sexo a los 13 años. Lo que quizá sí ocurra es que desde bien pequeñitas aprendan que disfrutar de su cuerpo no es malo, lo compartan con sus padres u otros adultos para que estos les resuelvan todas sus dudas y puedan hacerlo seguras, cuando quieran, con protección y se una forma satisfactoria. En general, hablar de sexo sin tapujos desde temprana edad puede ayudar a que esas niñas no solo tengan una vida sexual mucho más plena sino que mejoren la comunicación con sus padres. El sexo no tiene que ser tabú, y, sobretodo, tú no eres quien para decidir cuándo y cómo descubren, exploran y aprenden los demás. Cada cual lo hace cuándo esté listo/a/e y cuente con la información necesaria que le pueden proporcionar los adultos. Viva hablar de sexo sin tapujos y la educación sexual desde temprana edad."",

what the demons are telling the government and it&#39;s people how to treat me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr because of police investigation to cause me to show in my mind that I have killed or

All these times ive sat in my car night after night.  Ive lost track of time in solitary confinement prolly should have marked the days on my dash bored.  Im struggling kind of.   My dog barks constantly at my neighbor like hair standing up and the energy has shifted.  I can feel it all over and i dont like this energy.  And im starting to get angry.   I know these ppl and i like them but i feel like they dont like me.  I try not to let it bother me cuz i really dont care who likes me but it does because i feel it.  I constantly feel the shifts and it wearing me out.  Im not trying to be rude but do schools for the blind teach you how to properly handle not being able to see because i feel blind but i feel everything.  Sometimes i see shadows and ive been wanting an infrared camera but thats what my 3rd eye is basically.  I sit here in the dark and It lights up with colors.  Im thankful for what i see but its not always good.  I really am looking for the new school shiver.  Are there schools for gifted kids.  Like my kids can see but they also see beyond what others see.  I see it as a good thing but i get labled as a schizophrenic.  Im not saying my kids are geniuses but im over here wanting to buy abandonned castles and turn them into schools for gifted kids.  Masterpiece by Atlantic Star. My son just walked up to me and he is covered in blue and red marker. But like Sat i saw a figure in the dark run up to me it was half blue half red like i saw it like i was looking at an infrared source. So your dream as the wonder cats may have manifested.  Lol. Im not really superstitious but i do believe in things that i dont understand and Ive seen the letters fall maybe upward and they were red.  Lol. Im in the matrix now.  Virtual insanity.  Im not sure how blind Stevie is but he has vision on a higher level but to what extent.  Like the blind man in the bible.  I dont think his eyesight was restored like ppl believe,  i think he saw things on a higher level and he became the town crazy person.  And is there documentation of his life after Jesus?  I think Scott Stapp is the original blind man in the bible for like real.  My brain is firing on a bunch of different cylindars."",
