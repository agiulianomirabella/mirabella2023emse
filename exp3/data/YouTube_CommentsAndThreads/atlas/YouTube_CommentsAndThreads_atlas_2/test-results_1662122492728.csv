Bill is as genuine as a cut throat business mogul, as he is tender and caring. Young Will brought that out in him as his do over son. Li would keep Bill on his square and she could be the one to make him believe every other woman was a has been. I'm rooting for Bill to practice what he preaches and move beyond his mid life crisis. Li is not a meddler like Katie, Brooke or Quinn. She is a loyal mother to Finn and she has class and dignity enough not to take sloppy seconds. Sorry Jack.

The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth&#39;s orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEarth&#39;s outer layer (lithosphere) is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. About 29% of Earth&#39;s surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which all together constitute the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth&#39;s polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth&#39;s interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth&#39;s magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWithin the first billion years of Earth&#39;s history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect Earth&#39;s atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth&#39;s distance from the Sun, physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinctions. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been described. Over 7.7 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival.[24]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEtymology\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChronology\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhysical characteristics\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOrbit and rotation\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHabitability\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHuman geography\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsteroids and artificial satellites\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCultural and historical viewpoint\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee also\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNotes\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReferences\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurther reading\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eExternal links\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast edited 3 days ago by Kheider\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRELATED ARTICLES\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVenus\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecond planet from the Sun in the Solar System\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEuropa (moon)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSmallest Galilean moon of Jupiter\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuture of Earth\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong term extrapolated geological and biological changes\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e￼\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContent is available under CC BY-SA 3.0 unless otherwise noted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrivacy policy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTerms of Use\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDesktop"",

According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 solar days, a period known as an Earth sidereal year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis 366.256 times, that is, a sidereal year has 366.256 sidereal days.[n 6]\n\nEarth￼￼\n\nThe Blue Marble, the first full-view photograph of the planet, was taken by Apollo 17 astronauts en route to the Moon in 1972\n\nDesignations\n\nAlternative names\n\nTerra, Tellus, Gaia, Gaea, the World, the GlobeAdjectivesEarthly, terrestrial, terran, tellurianOrbital characteristicsEpoch J2000[n 1]Aphelion152100000 km[n 2]\n(94500000 mi)Perihelion147095000 km[n 2]\n(91401000 mi)\n\nSemi-major axis\n\n149598023 km[1]\n(92955902 mi)Eccentricity0.0167086[1]\n\nOrbital period\n\n365.256363004 d[2]\n(31558149.7635 s)\n\nAverage orbital speed\n\n29.78 km/s[3]\n(107200 km/h; 66600 mph)\n\nMean anomaly\n\n358.617°Inclination\n\n7.155° to the Sun's equator;\n\n1.57869°[4] to invariable plane;\n\n0.00005° to J2000 ecliptic\n\nLongitude of ascending node\n\n−11.26064°[3] to J2000 ecliptic\n\nTime of perihelion\n\n2021-Jan-02 13:59[5]\n\nArgument of perihelion\n\n114.20783°[3]Satellites\n\n1 natural satellite: the Moon\n\n5 quasi-satellites\n\n\u003e1 800 operational artificial satellites[6]\n\n\u003e16 000 space debris[n 3]\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nMean radius\n\n6371.0 km (3958.8 mi)[7]\n\nEquatorial radius\n\n6378.1 km (3963.2 mi)[8][9]\n\nPolar radius\n\n6356.8 km (3949.9 mi)[10]Flattening0.0033528[11]\n1/298.257222101 (ETRS89)Circumference\n\n40075.017 km equatorial (24901.461 mi)[9]\n\n40007.86 km meridional (24859.73 mi)[12][n 4]\n\nSurface area\n\n510072000 km2 (196940000 sq mi)[13][14][n 5]\n\n148940000 km2 land (57510000 sq mi; 29.2%)\n\n361132000 km2 water (139434000 sq mi; 70.8%)\n\nVolume1.08321×1012 km3 (2.59876×1011 cu mi)[3]Mass5.97237×1024 kg (1.31668×1025 lb)[15]\n(3.0×10−6 M☉)\n\nMean density\n\n5.514 g/cm3 (0.1992 lb/cu in)[3]\n\nSurface gravity\n\n9.80665 m/s2 (1 g; 32.1740 ft/s2)[16]\n\nMoment of inertia factor\n\n0.3307[17]\n\nEscape velocity\n\n11.186 km/s[3]\n(40270 km/h; 25020 mph)\n\nSidereal rotation period\n\n0.99726968 d[18]\n(23h 56m 4.100s)\n\nEquatorial rotation velocity\n\n0.4651 km/s[19]\n(1674.4 km/h; 1040.4 mph)\n\nAxial tilt\n\n23.4392811°[2]Albedo\n\n0.367 geometric[3]\n\n0.306 Bond[3]\n\nSurface temp.minmeanmaxKelvin184 K[20]287.16 K[21] (years 1961–1990)330 K[22]Celsius−89.2 °C14.0 °C (years 1961–1990)56.7 °CFahrenheit−128.5 °F57.2 °F (years 1961–1990)134.0 °FAtmosphere\n\nSurface pressure\n\n101.325 kPa (at MSL)Composition by volume\n\n78.08% nitrogen (N\n2; dry air)[3]\n\n20.95% oxygen (O\n2)\n\n~ 1% water vapor (climate variable)\n\n0.9340% argon\n\n0.0408% carbon dioxide[23]\n\n0.00182% neon[3]\n\n0.00052% helium\n\n0.00017% methane\n\n0.00011% krypton\n\n0.00006% hydrogen\n\nEarth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.\n\nEarth's outer layer (lithosphere) is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which all together constitute the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.\n\nWithin the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinctions. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been described. Over 7.7 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival.[24]\n\nEtymology\n\nChronology\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nOrbit and rotation\n\nHabitability\n\nHuman geography\n\nMoon\n\nAsteroids and artificial satellites\n\nCultural and historical viewpoint\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\nLast edited 3 days ago by Kheider\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nVenus\n\nSecond planet from the Sun in the Solar System\n\nEuropa (moon)\n\nSmallest Galilean moon of Jupiter\n\nFuture of Earth\n\nLong term extrapolated geological and biological changes\n\n￼\n\nContent is available under CC BY-SA 3.0 unless otherwise noted.\n\nPrivacy policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nDesktop"",

If he spent a bit of time analyzing motion a bit better, he would have realized that motion can not occur unless it occurs within a 4D space-time environment. The simple observation, is the fact that MOTION contains Two variables. 1) Distance and  2) Speed. Variables range from zero to infinity.

It discusses, for example, how time is experienced differently in the different ‘skies’ or ‘dimensions’ of the universe. It’s mentioned that there are 7 such ‘skies’ or ‘dimensions’ (in fact – we’re told the observable stars belong to only the first sky/dimension). For example, one verse translates roughly to: “He arranges [each] matter from the heaven to the earth; then it will ascend to Him in a Day, the extent of which is a thousand years of those which you count.” [32:5] I find it very interesting, especially given it was revealed about 1400 years ago :) If you’re interested in learning more don’t hesitate to ask."",
              ""textOriginal"": ""Really fascinating. One thing I personally find interesting is the discussion of time relativity in the Quran, which was revealed about 1400 years ago.  It discusses, for example, how time is experienced differently in the different ‘skies’ or ‘dimensions’ of the universe.

            ""textDisplay"": ""\u003cb\u003eComments are being suppressed, to cover up a genocide happening like during WW2, news media no commenting =propaganda, which can&#39;t stand scrutiny.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic and now under a corona virus /monkey pox pandemic.  It is not Russia or China spraying American skies in parallel lines.  It is not China or Russia venting gases to take your breath away in your dwellings.  You need a radiation detector and an air quality monitor with logging.  It usually happens at night while you sleep and you probably don&#39;t even know.  Military jets spray an X over your house to be targeted by sub orbital space weapon. Vaccines(Computer vaccines) hide information from you.  When you think that they are talking about real viruses, they are actually taking about electronic generated information that they must suppress by forcing a computer anti virus signature that looks for information and deletes it as harmful to you.  If too much information gets out then they lock you down to stop its spread and exterminate those who know, claiming it was a virus that got them.  NATO is the military arm of Revelation17,18, and is about to start a war with China, saying they attacked Taiwan.  Taiwan until very recently was acknowledged by the majority of all nations of the world as being part of China.  Taiwan has no embassy, as they are not a Country.  It was just recently changed on US documents in order to start the coming war.  The US has just passed a law similar to the one during WW2, to supply endless weapons to Taiwan.  WW2 China attacked from Taiwan after it&#39;s invasion.  Donald Trump told 3.5years in advance how the US would soon be waging war with Russia and China.  This is all staged by Rome.  The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State of Rome Italy.  He rules over the soon to be ten Nations of the Roman Empire.  The Country is the smallest in the world, and has its own flag and representatives in the UN, and other political bodies.  The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Churchbut also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms.  Empires in the Bible are referred to as beasts, and Rome&#39;s image to represent it is the cross or X, which symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,&quot;get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her&quot;. Revelation 18:4 Get out of her &quot;MY PEOPLE!&quot;  Ukraine killed NAZI Pow&#39;s because they were talking.  Revealing their NAZI affiliations.  The Red Cross is part of the Roman system masquerading as an aid organizationbut is military intelligence.  It has the (M.O.B.) mark of the beast as it&#39;s emblem.   Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a Western backed coup in 2014, which forensic evidence told a different story than video evidence, so there was  a conspiracy.  Western media changed the name of the Ukraine Capital from a Russian name to some thing else.  The Russian language, history and culture were hidden and suppressed.  Those with out blue arm bands would be put to death by Ukrainian forces run by foreigners.  Zellensky says that Ukraine will become a Catholic State under the Pope, and that is why Roman Catholics Nancy Palosi and Joe Biden are supporting the war against Ukraine and Russia. Why does Nancy Pelosi look like a protitute who has had recent plastic surgery?  She is just a corpse controlled by Rome in it&#39;s mission of conquest.  Imagine Germany flying in to PEI(Prince Edward Island) Canada against Canada&#39;s wishes and saying they will supply them with unlimited arms to fight Canada.  Eighty five percent of the people of PEI don&#39;t want to separate.  Then Germany says that Canada is flying over PEI&#39;s air space, and makes the world think that Canada is violating PEI.  Germany sends an immoral person to PEI, that has been picked for her low morals and willingness to go a long with any scheme.  Germany sends military jets of theirs and Japan&#39;s to escort the woman to PEI, a long with 5 aircraft carrier battle groups. Imagine that!  Or what if this happened to Alaska?  Well this is happeningbut not to PEIbut to Taiwan and China.  Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Countrybut part of Canada.  It was not Germanybut backed by NATO.  The Pope&#39;s terror squad. These wars are to hide Revelation 17,18&#39;s identity, and to distract you from the 1918/WW2 like genocide.  Comments are being edited by G7 Nations.(security reasons). Truth can stand on it&#39;s own two feetbut lies have to be propped up. Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023 Executive Order 14067 sec#4 to control buying and selling.  WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a &quot;temporary&quot; measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it&#39;s use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. 85% of Taiwanese want to remain a part of Chinabut that does not stop Rome from fomenting an other war to distract people from it being publicly exposed as fraud.  All the fraudulent leaders must keep Rome propped up to keep their own deceptive systems a float. In the West, there is a lot of corrupt media pretending that Taiwan is it&#39;s own Country and China wants to absorb it. Religious people say follow Godbut in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth.  God tells you there, what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  No wonder the world is such a mess, as people are following Satan as if God.  The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new name =different avenue of attack.   A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  How would that be constitutional or even lawful?  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  *One\u003c/b\u003e is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  \u003cb\u003eTwo\u003c/b\u003e the second virus is the virus that attacks the head of actual humans.  Signs are sneezing and head pain.  Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing them to sneeze and eventually die(zyklon b, extermination gas that causes you to suffocate).  Look in to the sky and you will see planes spraying the sky in parallel patterns, just before an outbreak. Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  Man can live for everbut it is being hide from you, by people who want to dominate and suppress you.  There are already technologies to heat and power cars and houses with out requiring any fuel. You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies.  Just like a car can be broken and used in a way that it was not designed, so can technology be exploited to do things that are not lawfully designed to do, and then attack tech because it is doing some thing it is not supposed to.  The government forces technogy to be breached by law enforcement, and then exploited for evil ends.  Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  They are trying to shut down microprocessor production.  Why did Nancy Pelosi by military escort breach a sovereign Nation&#39;s land where the microprocessor&#39;s are made?  Think!  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire.  Look at early 15th century Magna Carta documents where it talks how Rome will pay back for the wholesale slaughter of populations.  It says to lock them down then go in and exterminate while they are isolated.  It was done under the guise of a typhus epidemic by Austrian/German Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler during WW2, and now they are doing it under a corona virus pandemic/ monkey pox pandemic. On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Russia built and controls the nuclear power plant and would not bomb themselves. Should the US unseal WW2 documents, as recent events point to them committing war crimes against Ukraine and Russia?  Were they on the Pope/Hitler&#39;s side?  Scott Ritter confirms US and UK committing war crimes in Ukraine.  G7+10 Nations of Rome=7 heads &amp; 10 horns of Revelation.  G7 =(Roman)Christian Nations.  !((()"",
            ""textOriginal"": ""*Comments are being suppressed, to cover up a genocide happening like during WW2, news media no commenting =propaganda, which can't stand scrutiny.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic and now under a corona virus /monkey pox pandemic.  It is not Russia or China spraying American skies in parallel lines.  It is not China or Russia venting gases to take your breath away in your dwellings.  You need a radiation detector and an air quality monitor with logging.  It usually happens at night while you sleep and you probably don't even know.  Military jets spray an X over your house to be targeted by sub orbital space weapon. Vaccines(Computer vaccines) hide information from you.  When you think that they are talking about real viruses, they are actually taking about electronic generated information that they must suppress by forcing a computer anti virus signature that looks for information and deletes it as harmful to you.  If too much information gets out then they lock you down to stop its spread and exterminate those who know, claiming it was a virus that got them.  NATO is the military arm of Revelation17,18, and is about to start a war with China, saying they attacked Taiwan.  Taiwan until very recently was acknowledged by the majority of all nations of the world as being part of China.  Taiwan has no embassy, as they are not a Country.  It was just recently changed on US documents in order to start the coming war.  The US has just passed a law similar to the one during WW2, to supply endless weapons to Taiwan.  WW2 China attacked from Taiwan after it's invasion.  Donald Trump told 3.5years in advance how the US would soon be waging war with Russia and China.  This is all staged by Rome.  The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State of Rome Italy.  He rules over the soon to be ten Nations of the Roman Empire.  The Country is the smallest in the world, and has its own flag and representatives in the UN, and other political bodies.  The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Churchbut also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms.  Empires in the Bible are referred to as beasts, and Rome's image to represent it is the cross or X, which symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,\""get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her\"". Revelation 18:4 Get out of her \""MY PEOPLE!\""  Ukraine killed NAZI Pow's because they were talking.  Revealing their NAZI affiliations.  The Red Cross is part of the Roman system masquerading as an aid organizationbut is military intelligence.  It has the (M.O.B.) mark of the beast as it's emblem.   Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a Western backed coup in 2014, which forensic evidence told a different story than video evidence, so there was  a conspiracy.  Western media changed the name of the Ukraine Capital from a Russian name to some thing else.  The Russian language, history and culture were hidden and suppressed.  Those with out blue arm bands would be put to death by Ukrainian forces run by foreigners.  Zellensky says that Ukraine will become a Catholic State under the Pope, and that is why Roman Catholics Nancy Palosi and Joe Biden are supporting the war against Ukraine and Russia. Why does Nancy Pelosi look like a protitute who has had recent plastic surgery?  She is just a corpse controlled by Rome in it's mission of conquest.  Imagine Germany flying in to PEI(Prince Edward Island) Canada against Canada's wishes and saying they will supply them with unlimited arms to fight Canada.  Eighty five percent of the people of PEI don't want to separate.  Then Germany says that Canada is flying over PEI's air space, and makes the world think that Canada is violating PEI.  Germany sends an immoral person to PEI, that has been picked for her low morals and willingness to go a long with any scheme.  Germany sends military jets of theirs and Japan's to escort the woman to PEI, a long with 5 aircraft carrier battle groups. Imagine that!  Or what if this happened to Alaska?  Well this is happeningbut not to PEIbut to Taiwan and China.  Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Countrybut part of Canada.  It was not Germanybut backed by NATO.  The Pope's terror squad. These wars are to hide Revelation 17,18's identity, and to distract you from the 1918/WW2 like genocide.  Comments are being edited by G7 Nations.(security reasons). Truth can stand on it's own two feetbut lies have to be propped up. Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023 Executive Order 14067 sec#4 to control buying and selling.  WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a \""temporary\"" measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it's use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. 85% of Taiwanese want to remain a part of Chinabut that does not stop Rome from fomenting an other war to distract people from it being publicly exposed as fraud.  All the fraudulent leaders must keep Rome propped up to keep their own deceptive systems a float. In the West, there is a lot of corrupt media pretending that Taiwan is it's own Country and China wants to absorb it. Religious people say follow Godbut in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth.  God tells you there, what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  No wonder the world is such a mess, as people are following Satan as if God.  The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new name =different avenue of attack.   A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  How would that be constitutional or even lawful?

            ""textDisplay"": ""What is quantum physics? Physics is a principle of law just as the laws of man as the laws of man are constructed by natural law. Law is like a math equation. At the beginning of law, you have one simple equation and as you go down in the authorities of law the law gets longer and more complex but less relative and less significant in it&#39;s application. So then the question arises, what is the beginning of the equation. That is a very simple conversation. Do you suppose that you exist outside of the space in which you are in? No. You cannot exist outside of where you physically are. You are in a building inside a planet inside a universe. That is your reality. It is also called geometry. You understand the shape of the house you are in and the space you have to live. You understand the shape of the planet that you are in to build your house. Physics cannot exist outside of the space in which they exist. Geometry defines the very parameters of reality and nothing can exist outside of reality. But here in lies the problem. A society in collapse does not live in reality to understand it. If you go to NASA and their WMAP results for geometry, you can read their explanations of the geometry of the universe. Now here&#39;s where they don&#39;t understand because of their psychological impairments. They observed that there was no observational difference between actual density and the critical density of space. Zero has no beginning and no end. Infinite ends where it begins. They are both non-observational. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. For every action of a factor of infinite there is an observation of zero. Because society has collapsed and the people psychologically impaired, they believe that their supremacy in their positions have overwritten the very basics of mathematics and that having no observational difference is a dictatorship of the result 0. You have to observe non-observational results over time or energy and the travel of light to differentiate the difference between 0 and infinite. They removed the center of a geometrical shape to prove that if you multiple any shape by the power infinite (there being no observational parameter surface in an infinite shape for visual confirmation) that the parameter functioning of a geometrical shape no longer applies. Thus an infinite sphere can be expressed as an infinite square or an infinite triangle. They went an extra step further and expressed the dimensions of a square as a rectangle for psychological effect as a rectangle expressing a flat sheet of paper would have overlapping layers of space when expanded infinitely. An observation of their psychological impairment being a direct result of intentionally attempting to use psychological warfare to justify the natural order of law. The only geometrical shape with no parameter surface and no edges is an infinite sphere. Any other shape would have overlapping or missing space. They are Flat Earthers by the power infinite. They also shoved the 4th dimension up their @$$es, because only a Newtonian gravitational field does cause curvature of space. The ironic fact being that in order to assess the application of a thermonuclear weapon, when the separation of a thermonuclear class of weapon from a regular weapon being it&#39;s effect on the 4th dimension, having to determine it&#39;s effect on the 4th dimension. They literally threw that out the window as far as possible and I don&#39;t think that one could relatively throw it any further away. Space can be expressed as parallel circles with infinite curvature forming flat parallel lines in the interior surface and accelerated expansion in the parameter functioning with a point of singularity of infinite mass, temperature, density, and volume at the center observed in it&#39;s gravitational field of dark matter and dark energy. Infinite curvature forms a flat line as infinite is non-observational. A center running parallel to it&#39;s surface. Two parallel lines representing the center and the interior surface of geometry. A circle around a circle always accelerating and expanding. Every time you draw a circle around a circle the next circle acceleratingly (pi, π r²) grows larger. The equation is Gµv=Singularity(replace ʌgµv) + 8πGTµv. There is no such thing as a cosmological constant. That is the observed effects of a point of singularity. Placing the cosmological constant on the other end of the equation would imply an effect of physics outside of geometry and outside of the very space in which physics can physically exist. After geometry, the law is written similar to that of accounting and the process similar to that of reconciliation. There is a debit and credit entry system. Two opposite sides of an equation both equaling each other but written in their equal and opposite effects. You understand what the laws of physics are in four dimensions. Now move to the other side of the equation and write the law in it&#39;s invert. Up is down, down is up, left is right, right is left, in is out, and out is in. For every laws of physics in 4 dimensions there is an equal and opposite reaction of equal and opposite laws of physics in 4 dimensions. Meaning, you cannot be a Flat Earther and claim that space can be expressed as one dimension to justify why you do not understand that space is factually eight dimensions. You understand what dark matter and dark energy is. You understand that it is observed where it is not physically located and where it is physically located cannot be observed. You understand that the gravitational field that we observe in this 4 dimensions is not the gravitational field of dark matter or dark energy. The two gravitational fields have equal force against each other preventing universal collapse. Below the surface of all points of space is the same point of space. You can go anywhere in the universe above the surface of space and when you go below the surface of space you end up in the same point of space at all times. The same point of space below the surface of space is observed in infinite density in all black holes. You know that all black holes cannot each be equally dense or they would all have an infinite gravitational field and the universe would collapse. Thus, strike anywhere in space with a thermonuclear weapon and strike all points of space at once. Not only is there curvature of space but infinite curvature. A burst of gamma rays on Earth travels spherically around the planet in the electromagnetic fields. It is the same principle in space except that the travel is infinite by infinite curvature. Force does not stop unless applied by an equal and opposite force. The movement of collapse would not initially stop and would apply the force of both this collapsing gravitation field and the gravitational field of dark matter and dark energy with it. The creation of black holes. We go one step further and explain what you call in science your Nemesis. The Sun being the center of the universe and a point of singularity cooled down to coexist with space as otherwise all of space would disintegrate from infinite temperature. The son of the sun being a star formed from the creation of the sun at the center of the universe fused with the point of singularity and made of the mass and energy of both sides of the surface of space. The star being a star that orbits around Earth. Thus, a star that orbits around Earth and is struck by any weapon used in space would neutron from the use of a thermonuclear EMP, a burst of gamma rays striking a star made of both energy and dark energy. Dark energy and dark matter being a male to this female energy and mass. It extends itself from where it is into the space of a female geometry. A neutral yielding in that side of the surface, male to this combination of both male and female on this side. A neutron star now being pulled in by the gravitational field of Earth as the very orbiting &quot;stars&quot; of space debris that would initially fall to Earth from the detonation. The magnetic field of the star casting the Earth into the Sun, a point of singularity equal to the weight and measurement of all of space. Universal implosion. The beginning and end.\r\u003cbr\u003e\r\u003cbr\u003eNotably, there is also the standard to deviate from facts and findings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat will be 50 million U.S. dollars please."",

Back then, though, it was like so many latina girls had both.  Like literally almost all of them just had these amazing bodies and beautiful faces as well.  I&#39;d see a latina that looked straight up like a supermodel and all the latino guys in the group (I was in the military so there was a lot of different races in our group of friends) they would all be like &quot;eh she&#39;s okay&quot;.  Then obsess over a very average white girl.  Nowadays people see it morebut back then it was like if a girl was latina she had to be smokin hot 11/10 perfection for people to recognize her as attractive.  I would probably be light-headed walking around south america.  I wouldn&#39;t even be able to think straight lmao.  Sorry to rant, just something weird I noticed.  Maybe it&#39;s even racist to say (putting one race over others) but just my opinion so sorry if it offends anyone, I mean it only as a compliment though."",

            ""textDisplay"": ""*Revealing world wide satanic conspiracy. Urgently look at a hidden message on Sainte Peter's Basilica, in Rome Italy!  Encoded in the statues on the building, for telling WW3!*  Look at these bible scriptures as further proof, Romans1:23, Deuteronomy5:8, Romans1:25, Revelation/ Apocalypse 17, 18, 18:4,6,24;John the Baptist, Jesus....Roman soldiers Peirced him, not Jews  The Mark of the beast is on the shield of the Empire and on top of their buildings.  *666 is on the three level crown(vicarivs filii dei).* Germany concealing historical information about WW2 and that Nazi war on Russia, which killed more of their population than almost all other nations involved combined.  The Pope never spoke out about the atrocities, even though informed.  *The French and Bolshevik revolutions infuriated Revelation/ Apocalypse 17,18, and that is why both Russia and France were attacked.  1798, the French Revolution ended the Bible's for told 1260 years of complete subjugation of the world, including the death penalty for observing the Sabbath (which is not (sun)day) and for Biblical festivals, like Passover(538AD was the beginning of the death decree, by Roman Consul(Emperor Justinian).*  The UK also had a secret they wanted hidden by the fog of WW2. *Turkey and Arab States are where Gog and Magog are of the Bible's Ezekiel 38, and surrounded by seas(Walid Shoebat), which to be driven in to as per the Bible's description.  Turkey is also directly north of Israel, and where the bible calls the \""seat of Satan\"". Constantinople(Roman Emperor Constantine's city, now Istanbul, Turkey) was headquarters of Rome in the past. Rosh means headbut just because Russia sounds like the Hebrew word for head, doesn't mean it is the head(Rosh) of Gog and Magog.  They are not even in the same Country.  Gog Magog war comes after the 1000 years of peace on earth.* A sovereign city is under attack in Florida USA, by an American Governor Ron Desantis, for speaking about Biblical matters. *He talks how it is waking people up, and must stop.  This is war over knowing God. The US claims to believe in Democracy and has in God we trust on moneybut are attacking God.*  80% of US money has been printed in the last couple years, with the stock market just better than the drop of the great depression of 1929 and still falling.  *NATO must be broken up, and is the greatest obstacle to peace in the world.  The time is quickly approaching for all nations to take control of oppressive business holdings of NATO Countries, as enemies of you and the world.*  Take away their terror production ability.  *NATO changed the name of Ukraine's Capital from a Russian word to some thing else. Refused to talk peace. US Senator Jim Risch on video says,\""we can not let this end\"", when reffering to the Ukraine war.  Stockpiles of NATO weapons were found in bunkers in Ukraine.  The evidence to invade Iraq, still has not been given, or Syria. NATO nations have military bases around the world(800+). They are masters of deception, and misdirecting anger.*  Revelation 18:6,24. *The church claims they are the new Jerusalem, and the Vatican represents God's temple, so the Pope is the one sitting in the (false) temple with 666 on his crown and the sign of the religion and empire in his hand(the cross).*  US Senator Lindsay Graham said that Ukraine's war is the US war, and that the year 2017 would be the year of offense(wow). That was before this so called invasion.  US's Mike Pompeo also said that the war would start in 2017.  *President Donald J. Trump said over 3 1/2 years ago that the US would soon be at war with Russia and China.*  Christian networks, behind the scenes are fomenting a war against China, using false attacks on Taiwan.  These people are totally evil. *NATO is the military arm of the beast system. (M.O.B. (cross/X) on flag). People pledge an allegiance to its supposed ideals. Bow to what the image(cross/2crossed swords of Islam/X of Rome) represents or die.  Catechism of the Catholic Church say no \""buy or sell\"" or greeting to any who leaves the cross(Church). Those who don't accept it, have fire rain down from heaven in the sight of men.*  Remember this! No man has greater love than this, that he give his life for his friends.  *Joe Biden now says, that the weapon stockpiles in Ukraine were there preemptively for when Russia attacked Ukraine.  So when the offensive attack came that Lindsay Graham, Mike Pomeo and Donald Trump were talking about in advance. Russia entered Ukraine because weaponization in Ukraine against Russia and because of killing of so called Russian separatists and sympathizers. NATO Countries are stealing Russian assets claiming on account of the warbut it seams to be the other way around.  NATO was attacking Russians in Ukraine and militarizing for an all out assault.  The West would not negotiate with Putin to prevent the escalation.

He authorized death by poison gas, electrocution and firing squad to the already authorized lethal injection. *America you are fighting for your life, don't choose cowardice, as the world counts on you!*  The world collectively belongs to all mankind.  *It is greedy people who try to usurp the resources and control.*  All people deserve dignity and their fair share. *This is not NATO helping Ukrainebut a NATO take over of Ukraine and war on Russia.

            ""textOriginal"": ""*Revealing world wide satanic conspiracy. Urgently look at a hidden message on Sainte Peter's Basilica, in Rome Italy!  Encoded in the statues on the building, for telling WW3!*  Look at these bible scriptures as further proof, Romans1:23, Deuteronomy5:8, Romans1:25, Revelation/ Apocalypse 17, 18, 18:4,6,24;John the Baptist, Jesus....Roman soldiers Peirced him, not Jews  The Mark of the beast is on the shield of the Empire and on top of their buildings.  *666 is on the three level crown(vicarivs filii dei).* Germany concealing historical information about WW2 and that Nazi war on Russia, which killed more of their population than almost all other nations involved combined.  The Pope never spoke out about the atrocities, even though informed.  *The French and Bolshevik revolutions infuriated Revelation/ Apocalypse 17,18, and that is why both Russia and France were attacked.  1798, the French Revolution ended the Bible's for told 1260 years of complete subjugation of the world, including the death penalty for observing the Sabbath (which is not (sun)day) and for Biblical festivals, like Passover(538AD was the beginning of the death decree, by Roman Consul(Emperor Justinian).*  The UK also had a secret they wanted hidden by the fog of WW2. *Turkey and Arab States are where Gog and Magog are of the Bible's Ezekiel 38, and surrounded by seas(Walid Shoebat), which to be driven in to as per the Bible's description.  Turkey is also directly north of Israel, and where the bible calls the \""seat of Satan\"". Constantinople(Roman Emperor Constantine's city, now Istanbul, Turkey) was headquarters of Rome in the past. Rosh means headbut just because Russia sounds like the Hebrew word for head, doesn't mean it is the head(Rosh) of Gog and Magog.  They are not even in the same Country.  Gog Magog war comes after the 1000 years of peace on earth.* A sovereign city is under attack in Florida USA, by an American Governor Ron Desantis, for speaking about Biblical matters. *He talks how it is waking people up, and must stop.  This is war over knowing God. The US claims to believe in Democracy and has in God we trust on moneybut are attacking God.*  80% of US money has been printed in the last couple years, with the stock market just better than the drop of the great depression of 1929 and still falling.  *NATO must be broken up, and is the greatest obstacle to peace in the world.  The time is quickly approaching for all nations to take control of oppressive business holdings of NATO Countries, as enemies of you and the world.*  Take away their terror production ability.  *NATO changed the name of Ukraine's Capital from a Russian word to some thing else. Refused to talk peace. US Senator Jim Risch on video says,\""we can not let this end\"", when reffering to the Ukraine war.  Stockpiles of NATO weapons were found in bunkers in Ukraine.  The evidence to invade Iraq, still has not been given, or Syria. NATO nations have military bases around the world(800+). They are masters of deception, and misdirecting anger.*  Revelation 18:6,24. *The church claims they are the new Jerusalem, and the Vatican represents God's temple, so the Pope is the one sitting in the (false) temple with 666 on his crown and the sign of the religion and empire in his hand(the cross).*  US Senator Lindsay Graham said that Ukraine's war is the US war, and that the year 2017 would be the year of offense(wow). That was before this so called invasion.  US's Mike Pompeo also said that the war would start in 2017.  *President Donald J. Trump said over 3 1/2 years ago that the US would soon be at war with Russia and China.*  Christian networks, behind the scenes are fomenting a war against China, using false attacks on Taiwan.  These people are totally evil. *NATO is the military arm of the beast system. (M.O.B. (cross/X) on flag). People pledge an allegiance to its supposed ideals. Bow to what the image(cross/2crossed swords of Islam/X of Rome) represents or die.  Catechism of the Catholic Church say no \""buy or sell\"" or greeting to any who leaves the cross(Church). Those who don't accept it, have fire rain down from heaven in the sight of men.*  Remember this! No man has greater love than this, that he give his life for his friends.  *Joe Biden now says, that the weapon stockpiles in Ukraine were there preemptively for when Russia attacked Ukraine.  So when the offensive attack came that Lindsay Graham, Mike Pomeo and Donald Trump were talking about in advance. Russia entered Ukraine because weaponization in Ukraine against Russia and because of killing of so called Russian separatists and sympathizers. NATO Countries are stealing Russian assets claiming on account of the warbut it seams to be the other way around.  NATO was attacking Russians in Ukraine and militarizing for an all out assault.  The West would not negotiate with Putin to prevent the escalation.  So seaze NATO property, confiscate their money in your Country, stop their monetary transactions and send them packing.*  Do to them, what they were doing.  *Why does the Roman Empire and Church(called Roman Catholic Church) exist, when the Bible in Revelation 17,18 says it is evil and responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth?

If Brooke and Ridge's marriage and love is so strong as Brooke claims then why is she so threatened with the family dinner.  Brooke is so stupid because she truly believes that Ridge is going to be on her and Hope's side in favor of taking his grandson Douglas from his son Thomas. Brooke is very hypocritical because she believes Taylor is using her own grandson Douglas in order to get closer to his grandfather Ridge.  I mean,  how soon Brooke has forgotten that she used Douglas and told Douglas to basically lie and keep Brooke's lies and deception regarding kissing Deacon Sharp.  Now, I  say,  who was using who.  Sheila Carter needs to kidnap Hope lol"",

            ""textDisplay"": ""2: 166. *When those who have been followed are freed from those who have been following, and they would see the punishment, and all their relations between them would be cut off.*\n\n167. *And those who have been following will say: “Indeed, if we had a chance, then we would free ourselves from among them just like they have freed themselves from us”! Thus, Lord Allah will show them their deeds as a cause of sorrow upon them, and they will never come out of the Fire!*\n\nThe scene of quarreling, blaming, accusing, arguing, and cursing between the hypocrites and their weakling followers in the Fire is warned in this verse. So for Arabic Quran reading Fujjar the read, heard, and touched verses will argue and witness against them and will push them into Hell. Today these wrongdoers are carrying the Book like the burden carrying donkeys as told in verse 62: 5. The following verses describe the scenarios of such Mujirims in the Hereafter:\n\n(1) Verse 4: 140 says: “Verily We have revealed upon you in the Book, if you hear verses of Lord being denied and mocked, then you don’t sit there with them until they involve in any other speech, (if you sit there) indeed, you are just like them; indeed, Lord Allah will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers all together in the Hell”.\n\n(2) Verse 14: 21 says: “They all will be unveiled before the Lord on a Day. Then the weaklings will say to the arrogant leaders: ‘Indeed, we had been following you, are you able to avert us from the punishment of Allah?’ They will reply: ‘If Allah had guided us, verily we would have guided you; it is the same for us whether we quarrel or be patient, nobody is there to save us’”.\n\n(3) Verses 26: 91-102 say: “The hades will be placed for the aimless, and it will be asked to them: ‘Where are they that you were serving besides Lord Allah? Can they help you or can they help themselves?’ Then you stack them (followers), the aimless (leaders), and all gangs of the Iblis in Hades. They will say by quarreling with each other: ‘By the Lord, indeed we were in obvious astray while we adopted equals to the Lord of the worlds for you, and none led us astray except the Mujirims. Then none is there for us as intercessors, nor any friend who testify the Truth; then indeed if we have a chance, we would be among the believers”.\n\n(4) Verses 28: 62-64 say: “And on the Day, Lord Allah will call out to them and ask: ‘Where are My associates whom you had been claiming?’ Then those upon whom the charge is pronounced will say: ‘Our Lord, these are the ones whom we made aimless! We made them aimless just as we were aimless. We absolve ourselves into you, it was not us they have been serving’. It will be said to them: ‘You call your associates’, then they will call them; then they will not respond to them, and they will see the punishment if they had been guided”!.\n\n(5) Verses 33: 66-68 say: “On the Day when their faces will be twisted in the Fire, they will say: ‘Woe to us! If we had only obeyed the Lord and obeyed the Messenger’; and will say: ‘Our Lord! Indeed we obeyed our chiefs and our arrogant leaders, then they led us astray from the Straightpath; our Lord! You give them a double punishment and curse them with a very great curse”.\n\n(6) Verses 34: 31-33 say: “And the disbelievers say: ‘We will never believe with this Reading nor with the One before It; and if you are seeing the condition of these wrongdoers made to stand before their Lord, they will throw one another with the words of blame. The weaklings will tell the arrogant ones: ‘If you were not there, we would have been believers’. The arrogant ones will tell the weaklings: ‘Did we obstruct you from the Guidance after It had reached you? Nay, you were the Mujirims’. The weaklings will say to the arrogant ones: ‘Nay, there was day-night plotting when you commanded us to disbelieve in the Lord and set up equals to Him. They will conceal their regret when they see the punishment, and We will put yokes upon the necks of these disbelievers. Will they be rewarded except for what they had been doing?”\n\n(7) Verses 37: 28-34 say: “The weaklings will say: ‘Indeed, it was you who used to come to us from the right side’. The arrogant ones will say: ‘Nay, you were not believers, we had not any authority upon you; nay, you had been such a rebellious people. Thus, Our Lord’s word has been applicable upon us, indeed we have to taste (the punishment). Thus we had made you aimless, indeed, we were aimless’. Then indeed, on that Day they will be associating in the punishment. Indeed, We will do so with the Mujirims”.\n\n(8) Verses 40: 47-50 say: “When they are quarreling in the Fire, the weaklings will tell the arrogant ones: ‘Indeed, we were following you, then are you able to reduce for us a portion from the Fire?’ The arrogant leaders will say: ‘Indeed, we, all are in it, indeed Lord Allah has judged among His servants’. And inmates of the Fire will ask the keepers of Hell (Angels): ‘You appeal to your Lord to lighten a day of the punishment from us’. Then keepers will ask: ‘Hadn’t the Messengers come to you with Explanations?’ Inmates will say: ‘Of course, they had’. Then the keepers will say: ‘Then you appeal, and the prayer of disbelievers increases nothing except astray”.\n\n(9) Verses 41: 26-29 say: “Those who are disbelievers will say: ‘You don’t hear this Reading (Adhikr), and you make noises therein so that you may succeed’. And We will make the disbelievers taste the severe punishment, and We will reward them for the worst deeds they have been doing. That will be the reward for the enemies of Lord, the Fire! For them will have an eternal house in it as a reward for they were repudiating with Our verses. And those who disbelieved will say: ‘Oh our Lord! You show us both the Jinns and humans who misled us so that we will crush both of them beneath our feet for we were the underdogs”.\n\n(10) Verses 43: 74-78 say: “Indeed, the Mujirims will remain in the punishment of Hell forever, it will not be eased for them and they will feel confounded in It. And We have not done any unjust to thembut they were unjust. They will call: ‘Oh Malik! May your Lord put an end to us’?

            ""textOriginal"": ""2: 166. *When those who have been followed are freed from those who have been following, and they would see the punishment, and all their relations between them would be cut off.*\n\n167. *And those who have been following will say: “Indeed, if we had a chance, then we would free ourselves from among them just like they have freed themselves from us”! Thus, Lord Allah will show them their deeds as a cause of sorrow upon them, and they will never come out of the Fire!*\n\nThe scene of quarreling, blaming, accusing, arguing, and cursing between the hypocrites and their weakling followers in the Fire is warned in this verse. So for Arabic Quran reading Fujjar the read, heard, and touched verses will argue and witness against them and will push them into Hell. Today these wrongdoers are carrying the Book like the burden carrying donkeys as told in verse 62: 5. The following verses describe the scenarios of such Mujirims in the Hereafter:\n\n(1) Verse 4: 140 says: “Verily We have revealed upon you in the Book, if you hear verses of Lord being denied and mocked, then you don’t sit there with them until they involve in any other speech, (if you sit there) indeed, you are just like them; indeed, Lord Allah will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers all together in the Hell”.\n\n(2) Verse 14: 21 says: “They all will be unveiled before the Lord on a Day. Then the weaklings will say to the arrogant leaders: ‘Indeed, we had been following you, are you able to avert us from the punishment of Allah?’ They will reply: ‘If Allah had guided us, verily we would have guided you; it is the same for us whether we quarrel or be patient, nobody is there to save us’”.\n\n(3) Verses 26: 91-102 say: “The hades will be placed for the aimless, and it will be asked to them: ‘Where are they that you were serving besides Lord Allah? Can they help you or can they help themselves?’ Then you stack them (followers), the aimless (leaders), and all gangs of the Iblis in Hades. They will say by quarreling with each other: ‘By the Lord, indeed we were in obvious astray while we adopted equals to the Lord of the worlds for you, and none led us astray except the Mujirims. Then none is there for us as intercessors, nor any friend who testify the Truth; then indeed if we have a chance, we would be among the believers”.\n\n(4) Verses 28: 62-64 say: “And on the Day, Lord Allah will call out to them and ask: ‘Where are My associates whom you had been claiming?’ Then those upon whom the charge is pronounced will say: ‘Our Lord, these are the ones whom we made aimless! We made them aimless just as we were aimless. We absolve ourselves into you, it was not us they have been serving’. It will be said to them: ‘You call your associates’, then they will call them; then they will not respond to them, and they will see the punishment if they had been guided”!.\n\n(5) Verses 33: 66-68 say: “On the Day when their faces will be twisted in the Fire, they will say: ‘Woe to us! If we had only obeyed the Lord and obeyed the Messenger’; and will say: ‘Our Lord! Indeed we obeyed our chiefs and our arrogant leaders, then they led us astray from the Straightpath; our Lord! You give them a double punishment and curse them with a very great curse”.\n\n(6) Verses 34: 31-33 say: “And the disbelievers say: ‘We will never believe with this Reading nor with the One before It; and if you are seeing the condition of these wrongdoers made to stand before their Lord, they will throw one another with the words of blame. The weaklings will tell the arrogant ones: ‘If you were not there, we would have been believers’. The arrogant ones will tell the weaklings: ‘Did we obstruct you from the Guidance after It had reached you? Nay, you were the Mujirims’. The weaklings will say to the arrogant ones: ‘Nay, there was day-night plotting when you commanded us to disbelieve in the Lord and set up equals to Him. They will conceal their regret when they see the punishment, and We will put yokes upon the necks of these disbelievers. Will they be rewarded except for what they had been doing?”\n\n(7) Verses 37: 28-34 say: “The weaklings will say: ‘Indeed, it was you who used to come to us from the right side’. The arrogant ones will say: ‘Nay, you were not believers, we had not any authority upon you; nay, you had been such a rebellious people. Thus, Our Lord’s word has been applicable upon us, indeed we have to taste (the punishment). Thus we had made you aimless, indeed, we were aimless’. Then indeed, on that Day they will be associating in the punishment. Indeed, We will do so with the Mujirims”.\n\n(8) Verses 40: 47-50 say: “When they are quarreling in the Fire, the weaklings will tell the arrogant ones: ‘Indeed, we were following you, then are you able to reduce for us a portion from the Fire?’ The arrogant leaders will say: ‘Indeed, we, all are in it, indeed Lord Allah has judged among His servants’. And inmates of the Fire will ask the keepers of Hell (Angels): ‘You appeal to your Lord to lighten a day of the punishment from us’. Then keepers will ask: ‘Hadn’t the Messengers come to you with Explanations?’ Inmates will say: ‘Of course, they had’. Then the keepers will say: ‘Then you appeal, and the prayer of disbelievers increases nothing except astray”.\n\n(9) Verses 41: 26-29 say: “Those who are disbelievers will say: ‘You don’t hear this Reading (Adhikr), and you make noises therein so that you may succeed’. And We will make the disbelievers taste the severe punishment, and We will reward them for the worst deeds they have been doing. That will be the reward for the enemies of Lord, the Fire! For them will have an eternal house in it as a reward for they were repudiating with Our verses. And those who disbelieved will say: ‘Oh our Lord! You show us both the Jinns and humans who misled us so that we will crush both of them beneath our feet for we were the underdogs”.\n\n(10) Verses 43: 74-78 say: “Indeed, the Mujirims will remain in the punishment of Hell forever, it will not be eased for them and they will feel confounded in It. And We have not done any unjust to thembut they were unjust. They will call: ‘Oh Malik! May your Lord put an end to us’? Malik will reply: ‘Indeed, you should abide therein forever, verily We had come to you with the Truthbut most among you were hating the Truth’”.

            ""textDisplay"": ""The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.\u003cbr\u003eStrategy\u003cbr\u003eHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent&#39;s hand.\u003cbr\u003eThe Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender&#39;s part, though be wary of spells.\u003cbr\u003eA Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter&#39;s splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.\u003cbr\u003eThe Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent&#39;s go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, this strategy isn&#39;t very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.\u003cbr\u003eAgainst non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze timebut this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.\u003cbr\u003eIt is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King&#39;s Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.\u003cbr\u003eIn a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent&#39;s card rotation.\u003cbr\u003eLong-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider&#39;s health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.\u003cbr\u003eWhen there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.\u003cbr\u003ePassive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent&#39;s side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.\u003cbr\u003eDefensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent&#39;s side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.\u003cbr\u003eIf the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.\u003cbr\u003eFor Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.\u003cbr\u003eFor Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.\u003cbr\u003eThey can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.\u003cbr\u003eThe Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.\u003cbr\u003eA Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player&#39;s King&#39;s Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Towerbut doing this more than three times may result in the King&#39;s Tower&#39;s health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted\u003cbr\u003eA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.\u003cbr\u003eThis can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effectivebut the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.\u003cbr\u003eThe Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.\u003cbr\u003eA Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.\u003cbr\u003ePairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent&#39;s defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.\u003cbr\u003eThe Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.\u003cbr\u003eA fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.\u003cbr\u003eA risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent&#39;s deck if they happen to react to him fast enough."",

Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.\nThe Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.\nA fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.\nA risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they happen to react to him fast enough."",

I also believe at the very early stages of pregnancy. What’s happening today in my country though is women using abortion as a form of contraception. Having multiple abortions. In some cases up to 5 months which is abhorrent. If it means banning abortion completely to stop this then I’m all for it but I think politically, middle ground needs to be agreed. When you see what actually happens to that unborn child during an abortion it makes you sick. It’s more humane to allow the baby to be born and smash it’s head in with a brick. At least it’s instant. A brutal death an abortion is. People go on about women rights but what about the rights of that child.

I agree, the antidepressant effects of K have nothing to do with the trip itself but rather how it impacts your brain after it&#39;s over. I have always viewed it as comparable to a near-death-experience, which, you really wouldn&#39;t want more than one of but most people report that it permanently changes their perspective on life. There are some oddballs who seem to enjoy K but I agree with you that there&#39;s nothing &quot;pleasant&quot; about the high itself. In a therapeutic setting, it seems like they use micro-dosing for a limited period of time based on a few testimonials I&#39;ve seen where people report feeling hardly anything. I have a few friends who have had good results with it in a therapeutic setting but I haven&#39;t had a chance to ask them how their experience was.
