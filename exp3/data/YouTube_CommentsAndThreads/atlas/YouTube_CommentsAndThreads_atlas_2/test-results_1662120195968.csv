If it&#39;s not about Brooke or Hope she finds a way to make it about her. She is only worried about Taylor because all the things she thinks that Taylor is doing is what she would do. Taylor has never used her kids the way Brooke has to keep a man. She doesn&#39;t manipulate others like Brooke loves to do. Anytime someone does something she doesn&#39;t like she accuses whoever it is that they are doing this to attack her. Taylor isn&#39;t using Douglas to intentionally hurt Hope or to get Ridge back. She is only pushing this because she believes that Thomas should be the one raising Douglas. If Brooke wants to fight it out with Thomas she and Hope will lose. The only reason Hope has any say is because Thomas has allowed it. Hope has no right to full custody and if it was brought to the courts she would lose Douglas completely. They didn&#39;t sign the custody papers with an attorney present and Thomas could simply say that Hope took advantage of Thomas while he wasn&#39;t in his right mind due to the brain trauma. Now Brooke will also lose Ridge if she goes after Thomas and tries to prevent him from living with Douglas. As much as they could accuse Thomas of, Thomas could do the same to Hope and Brooke. The thing about Brooke and Hope is that they are incapable of learning from there mistakes. Brooke almost lost Ridge the last time she pulled this with trying to take Douglas permanently from Thomas. She&#39;s to blinded by her narcissism that she will do the same thing again and she will drive Ridge right to Taylor. Hope is also repeating her selfish behavior believing that Douglas can only be happy under her constant care. It&#39;s really no different than when Hope insisted that Deacon be allowed to come and go from the property without caring about anyone else&#39;s feelings, including her own husband. Brooke has raised Hope that she is entitled to anything and everything she wants and if she doesn&#39;t get it, it&#39;s someone else&#39;s fault and whoever is in her way Brooke tells Hope that something malicious is being done to her. Their mentality about how the real world works is delusional and harmful to themselves but they will never be able to see that, unfortunately for them. If you&#39;re never wrong, there&#39;s never a chance to learn and grow and Brooke and Hope are never in the wrong according to them. Taylor, Steffy, Thomas and Ridge are no saint&#39;s but at least they don&#39;t ever think that they are never in the wrong. Last point I will make is this, Brooke and Hope always accuse others for their behavior that they are doing or would do if the situation is reversed and that&#39;s hardly ever the case. Just like when Brooke accused Taylor of trying to break up Hope and Liam when Steffy had amnesia.  Taylor was not at all doing that, she was only trying to protect Steffy&#39;s physical and mental health but because that&#39;s what Brooke would have done if the situation was reversed she thought that Taylor was going to do what she would have done.  If Hope was the good person she says she is then she would have let Douglas live with Thomas and have true partial custody where Douglas lives with her half the time and Thomas the other half the minute Thomas saved Liam from jail but she didn&#39;t because she only thinks about herself and her needs."",

              ""textDisplay"": ""@Nicole Brown I would rather have a mother who knows what&#39;s best for herself and if my mother was still in love with her ex-husband and being around him and his crazy wife was making her miserable I would much rather her go and try to be happy somewhere else. It doesn&#39;t mean that she can&#39;t be a good mom just because she doesn&#39;t live in the same city.  It was always said that Taylor was very involved in what was going on with her kids. So to answer your question I would like a mother like that.  If given the choice between Brooke or Taylor as a mother, I would take Taylor over Brooke every time. Brooke is the worst mother any child could have. Look at the damage she inflicted upon all her kids. Brooke is a very selfish mother and she has always used her children to try and get a man or to keep a man.  Her youngest two son&#39;s RJ and Jack weren&#39;t even raised by her. RJ went to boarding school and who knows where Jack is. She has turned Hope into this little insecure crybaby who can&#39;t deal with not getting her way and has no idea how the world really works. She destroyed Eric Jr by forcing him to grow up in an a home where his halfbrother was also his stepfather.  She did the same with Bridget plus so so so much more.  Rick and Bridget both had to deal with that not just with Ridge but with Thorne as well.  How could any mother do that to their children? Last I would also like to add again that they did not have an actress to play Taylor so you&#39;re basing your opinion on the character of Taylor that doesn&#39;t apply to the situations that the writers had to take. Not having Taylor in the storyline doesn&#39;t mean that she did all the things you are claiming she did or to be more accurate she didn&#39;t do as a mother. It also doesn&#39;t mean that you are wrong and Taylor could have done all those things you are accusing her of but because we the audience weren&#39;t told we will never know. So basing your opinion on that specific information is meaningless because you don&#39;t have the answer, none of us do.  So instead it is more logical to look at Taylors character as a whole throughout the show and see her past behavior and patterns to infer what she would have done in the situations that happened off screen.   Taylor&#39;s pattern is to always be there for her children no matter where she is. Keep in mind that the reason Taylor was absent according to the story was because she was doing charity work and helping people all over the world. That fact proves my whole point."",

As for the character of Taylor in general I stand by what I said in my previous post. I gave you three examples to back up my point and it still wasn&#39;t enough so let me give you a few more examples. A more recent situation was when she helped Thomas with his issues. Granted you didn&#39;t see it on screen but it was mentioned by others. She helped James Worwick (sp?) confront his father and past trauma. She tried to help Morgan get pregnant and paid dearly for it. Ridge slept with Morgan, she kidnapped Steffy and convinced everyone that Steffy died. Then she kidnapped Taylor and tried to kill her. Taylor has tried to help Shelia at great cost to herself many times. You said that you don&#39;t remember anyone who she helped which makes no sense because I gave you a perfect example when I said she helped amber when no one else would and she even saved amber from Shelia right before Shelia shot Taylor.  I find it interesting that I just gave you more examples of Taylor helping others and you couldn&#39;t give me one instance where Brooke selflessly helped one person. Taylor has helped Stephanie, Eric, Amber, Ridge, Kristen and Anthony, Eric Jr, Bridget, Felicia, Katie and even Brooke. So please tell me again why you think Taylor hasn&#39;t helped anyone."",

Now they punish both or just the kid they stood up for themselves. It makes them never able to command the respect they deserve so it boils over and drives them to do awful things. I was bullied all through school for being a little over weight so I know how it feels. When i hit highschool they finally stopped once i broke the school record with a 405 lb bench press and 620 lb squat and 600 lb deadlift. I wasn’t the fat kid anymore, i was the big ass kid strong enough to snap your bones. The only issue i had after that was when I fractured a vertebrae in my spine when i was dead lifting. I could barely bend over and I needed help getting my backpack off the floor. This smaller guy was in my PE class know of my problem and while we where walking laps around the track he threw a football at the exact spot i had the break. Boy I turned around and chased his ass down and tackled him and beat the absolute shit out of him. I didn’t care about my back at all at that point, i just saw red for a few seconds lol. But after that I helped him up and said sorry but you hit the exact spot where my back was broken and i lost my cool and he apologized too. That same day were buds. He said it scared the shit out of him. To this day we are still buds lol. I know it sounds like a r/that happened post but it’s legit. We had the zero tolerance rule but we weren’t under any supervision at the time so neither of us got in trouble for it."",

              ""textDisplay"": ""@Ima Done calling Taylor and Alcoholic with Brooke’s history is laughable. And attempting to kill Bill Spenser the same person who literally has tried to kill other people is like saying she tried to kill Shiela. That feels like more of a pro than a con. Being mad at someone for keeping a secret that isn’t actually there secret to tell is not something I think any therapist would do so the writers probably made the right call with that Stephanie angle. But again I don’t know how that and cheating with whip falls against the backdrop of being a serial cheater. Brooke literally slept with an entire family of men and had kids with a father and son. If that’s not messy, then I don’t what is. She manipulated Thorns wife to her death because she simply could not be without a man. But You’re right that they’ve both done bad things… for what human doesn’t? But if you’re comparing the two women by the same set of standards then you shouldn’t be surprised that someone else disagrees. Even when Steffy was in the hospital just recently and everyone is scared for her, all Brooke cared about was when is Ridge coming home to her. And that’s after all she previously cared about was her GROWN Daughters happiness. And her husband, who told her he simply could not have Deacon coming into the home he shares with her whenever he likes. And Ridge was right btw, because Deacon did try to take advantage while actively plotting with Shiela. He kissed Brooke twice, once when she was drunk and again when she was stone cold sober and she didn’t even attempt to stop him. But then conveniently never told Ridge about that did she? But she was quick to take her daughters side over her husband’s and thought nothing of making him feel like it wasn’t his home and he has no say so. No self respecting man would ever go back to woman who disrespects him like that. Her spoiled ass privileged daughter who has a habit of naggingly and whining to get what she wants kept doing that instead of being an adult and actually moving out to stop all the drama. But she only threatened moving out to emotionally blackmail her mother into giving her what she wanted. And looked what that caused? The Apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. And don’t get me wrong Steffy is manipulative too but at least she’s direct, hope likes to put on a facade that she’s innocent when really she’s actually more dangerous than her mother. Because at least you can see Brooke coming. But her youngest daughter is even more cunning and sneaky. The only other thing Brooke cared about while coming to the hospital was that Liam shouldn’t help Steffy because “Her Daughter” is going to suffering some discomfort. Because no matter what is going on it always has to be about Brooke. She’s the queen of getting second chances but then so quick to pass judgment on others. And notice not one time did she actually go into the room to visit Steffy. She thought it would be better to fight with Taylor about what both Taylor and Bridget said should be the best course of action. I’m sorry but that woman is emotionally tone deaf. And has zero self awareness of what she’s saying as she’s actively saying it. And it’s pretty disgusting sometimes. I often wonder if the writers actually like Brooke’s character because the way they write for her it often doesn’t seem like they do. Brooke’s behavior at the hospital should tell everyone what they need to know about her character. She’s not just deeply flawed, she super self-involved to the point of being completely apathetic to anyone else’s wants or needs. There isn’t an emotionally stable Man alive that would put up with her shit. Trying to paint Taylor with the same brush is like trying to compare someone who purposefully done messed up things to people to someone who due to the circumstances surrounding the situation does so unintentionally. Or finds themselves in a No-win situation. While that doesn’t absolve rightful blame it doesn’t meet the same Standard of such applauding acts carried out by Brooke. And I like Kelly Lang the actress but Brooke Logan is definitely not a good person. And she often purposely chooses not to be."",

He kissed Brooke twice, once when she was drunk and again when she was stone cold sober and she didn’t even attempt to stop him. But then conveniently never told Ridge about that did she? But she was quick to take her daughters side over her husband’s and thought nothing of making him feel like it wasn’t his home and he has no say so. No self respecting man would ever go back to woman who disrespects him like that. Her spoiled ass privileged daughter who has a habit of naggingly and whining to get what she wants kept doing that instead of being an adult and actually moving out to stop all the drama. But she only threatened moving out to emotionally blackmail her mother into giving her what she wanted. And looked what that caused? The Apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. And don’t get me wrong Steffy is manipulative too but at least she’s direct, hope likes to put on a facade that she’s innocent when really she’s actually more dangerous than her mother. Because at least you can see Brooke coming. But her youngest daughter is even more cunning and sneaky. The only other thing Brooke cared about while coming to the hospital was that Liam shouldn’t help Steffy because “Her Daughter” is going to suffering some discomfort. Because no matter what is going on it always has to be about Brooke. She’s the queen of getting second chances but then so quick to pass judgment on others. And notice not one time did she actually go into the room to visit Steffy. She thought it would be better to fight with Taylor about what both Taylor and Bridget said should be the best course of action. I’m sorry but that woman is emotionally tone deaf. And has zero self awareness of what she’s saying as she’s actively saying it. And it’s pretty disgusting sometimes. I often wonder if the writers actually like Brooke’s character because the way they write for her it often doesn’t seem like they do. Brooke’s behavior at the hospital should tell everyone what they need to know about her character. She’s not just deeply flawed, she super self-involved to the point of being completely apathetic to anyone else’s wants or needs. There isn’t an emotionally stable Man alive that would put up with her shit. Trying to paint Taylor with the same brush is like trying to compare someone who purposefully done messed up things to people to someone who due to the circumstances surrounding the situation does so unintentionally. Or finds themselves in a No-win situation. While that doesn’t absolve rightful blame it doesn’t meet the same Standard of such applauding acts carried out by Brooke. And I like Kelly Lang the actress but Brooke Logan is definitely not a good person. And she often purposely chooses not to be."",
