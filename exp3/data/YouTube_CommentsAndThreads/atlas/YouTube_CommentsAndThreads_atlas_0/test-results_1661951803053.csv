Wagner miedkait@rams.colostate.edu\n\n\r\nABSTRACT\n\n\r\nBackground/Introduction: Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an invariably fatal prion disease affecting captive and free-ranging cervids, including white-tailed deer, mule deer, moose, elk, and reindeer. Since the initial description of the disease in the 1960’s, CWD has spread to 23 states, 3 Canadian Provinces, South Korea, Norway and, most recently, Finland. While some outbreaks of CWD were caused by transport of infected animals from endemic regions, the origin of CWD in other epizootics is unclear and has not been characterized. Previous studies have shown that there are two distinct strains of CWD. However, the continuous spread and the unclear origin of several outbreaks warrant continued surveillance and further characterization of strain diversity.\r\nMaterials and Methods: To address these knowledge gaps, we used biochemical tests to assess strain differences between CWD outbreaks in Michigan, Texas, Missouri, and Colorado, USA. Brain or lymph node samples were homogenized and digested in 50 µg/mL proteinase K (PK). These samples were then run on a Western blot to assess glycoform ratio and electrophoretic mobility. Texas samples were digested in 100 µg/mL PK. To assess conformational stability, brain or lymph node homogenates were incubated in increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride from 0 M to 4 M in 0.5 M increments. Samples were then precipitated in methanol overnight, washed and PK digested in 50 µg/mL PK before slot blotting.\r\nResults: Our results have found significant differences in glycoform ratio between CWD from Michigan and Coloradobut no differences were observed in conformational stability assays. Interestingly, when testing our CWD isolates from Texas to analyse electrophoretic mobility and glycoform ratio, we found that these samples did not exhibit the characteristic band shift when treated with PKbut PK resistant material remained. Additionally, results from our conformational stability assay demonstrate a unique profile of these Texas isolates. Testing of samples from Missouri is currently underway.\n\n\r\nConclusions: Thus far, our data indicate that there are strain differences between CWD circulating in Michigan and CWD in Colorado and provide important insight into CWD strain differences between two non-contiguous outbreaks. We have also identified a unique strain of CWD in Texas with biochemical strain properties not seen in any of our other CWD isolates. These results highlight the importance of continued surveillance to better understand this devastating disease. These results have important implications for CWD emergence, evolution and our understanding of prion strain heterogeneity on the landscape.\n\n\r\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19336896.2019.1615197\n\n\r\nSUNDAY, APRIL 14, 2019\n\n\r\nChronic Wasting Disease TSE Prion Strains everything in Texas is bigger, better, and badder The disease devastating deer herds may also threaten human health\n\n\r\nScientists are exploring the origins of chronic wasting disease before it becomes truly catastrophic. Rae Ellen Bichell\n\n\r\nImage credit: David Parsons/Istock\n\n\r\nApril 8, 2019\n\n\r\nWagner and Zabel have suggested a possible answer: Perhaps, they say, there is not just one chronic wasting diseasebut rather a bunch of different strains of it. And those different strains could be emerging at different times across the globe.\n\n\r\nOne day in late February, in their laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado, Wagner and Zabel compared the prions from the brains of CWD-infected deer in Texas with those of elk in Colorado. They want to know if the proteins were all mangled in the same way, or not. “If they are different, this would suggest that we have different strain properties, which is evidence as we're building our case that we might have multiple strains of CWD circulating in the U.S.,” says Wagner.\n\n\r\nStep one is to see if they’re equally easy to destroy using a chemical called guanidine. The shape of a prion dictates everything, including the way it interacts with an animal’s cells and the ease with which chemicals can unfold it.\n\n\r\n“Moment of truth,” said Wagner, as she and Zabel huddled around a computer, waiting for results to come through. When they did, Zabel was surprised.\r\n“Wow,” he said. “Unlike anything we've seen before.”\n\n\r\nThe prions from the Texas deer were a lot harder to destroy than the ones from the Colorado elk. In fact, the guanidine barely damaged them at all. “We’ve never seen that before in any prion strain, which means that it has a completely different structure than we've ever seen before,” says Zabel. And that suggests that it might be a very different kind of chronic wasting disease. The researchers ran the same test on another Texas deer, with the same results.\n\n\r\nNow, these are only the preliminary results from a few animals. Wagner and Zabel have a lot more experiments to do. But if future tests come to the same conclusion, it would support their hypothesis that there are multiple strains of chronic wasting disease out there, all with different origins. That, in turn, could mean that this disease will become even trickier to manage than it already is.\n\n\r\nAnd, Zabel adds, there’s something else. “If it's still evolving, it may still evolve into a form that could potentially, eventually affect humans,” he says.\n\n\r\nZabel is not the only one worried about that possibility.\n\n\r\nOSTERHOLM, THE EPIDEMIOLOGIST from Minnesota, is also concerned. He directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, and is serving a one-year stint as a “Science Envoy for Health Security” with the U.S. State Department. In February, he told Minnesota lawmakers that when it comes to chronic wasting disease, we are playing with fire. “You are going to hear from people that this is not going to be a problem other than a game farm issue. You're going to hear from people that it's not going to transmit to people, and I hope they're rightbut I wouldn't bet on it,” he said. “And if we lose this one and haven’t done all we can do, we will pay a price.”\n\n\r\nIf that wasn’t warning enough, he added: “Just remember what happened in England.”\n\n\r\nhttps://www.hcn.org/articles/wildlife-the-disease-devastating-deer-herds-may-also-threaten-human-healthscience/view\n\n\r\nSnip...\n\n\r\n\r\nTerry S.
