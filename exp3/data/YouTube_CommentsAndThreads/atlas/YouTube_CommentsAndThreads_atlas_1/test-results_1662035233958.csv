For example, one verse translates roughly to: “He arranges [each] matter from the heaven to the earth; then it will ascend to Him in a Day, the extent of which is a thousand years of those which you count.” [32:5] I find it very interesting, especially given it was revealed about 1400 years ago :) If you’re interested in learning more don’t hesitate to ask."",

I'm going to make an example to demonstrate everything I know about space-time, if you see anything \""fishy\"", please do point it out.\n\nImagine that there are two space racers on their vehicle, their destination is roughly 10 miles away from their current position. Both racers have a clock in their vehicle to measure the amount of time it takes them to travel 10 miles. Racer A is traveling towards his destination at the speed of 10 miles per hour, while Racer B is traveling at 5 miles per hour. It takes Racer A an hour to reach his destination, his watch somehow managed to stop the nanosecond he reached his destination. However, despite the fact Racer A's clock has stopped counting time, Racer B is only halfway thus his clock is still counting. An hour later Racer B reached his destination, and his clock stopped counting time as instantly as Racer A's. Regardless of whatever X, Y, and Z are, there was a clear difference in time between the two. Does this mean time for Racer A was 2x slower to Racer B?"",
