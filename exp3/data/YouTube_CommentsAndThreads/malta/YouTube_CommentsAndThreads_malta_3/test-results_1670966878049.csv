Kanye deserved to be vilified for his threat against Jews. This isn&#39;t about understanding them - that&#39;s what we do with folks who DON&#39;T hurt other people. With people who hurt other people, conversation won&#39;t work. That&#39;s like trying to have a conversation with Trump about his inappropriate, vile tweets. It&#39;s useless. Dave Chapelle wasn&#39;t &quot;talking&quot; or &quot;debating&quot; about trans people, he was vilifying them and making fun of them. That perpetuates predjudice and violence. That&#39;s NOT talking about things. That&#39;s NOT debate. If Dave Chapelle is a good friend of yours, try telling him his transphobia is baseless and he needs to change. I&#39;m curious to know if you can reach him as you say &quot;we&quot; can.

It's an excuse and they use it to their advantage.¬†They use to to make people feel sorry for them. Excuses give them the chance to keep on abusing and hurtingbut what is needed are apologies, atonement, and changed behavior. \n\nSorry Jon, we will call out prejudice every single time. Don't bury it or censor it, call it out and vilify it. There have to be consequences for it. Dave Chapelle deserved to be called out for his transphobic \""comedy\"" on Netflix. Kanye deserved to be vilified for his threat against Jews. This isn't about understanding them - that's what we do with folks who DON'T hurt other people. With people who hurt other people, conversation won't work. That's like trying to have a conversation with Trump about his inappropriate, vile tweets. It's useless. Dave Chapelle wasn't \""talking\"" or \""debating\"" about trans people, he was vilifying them and making fun of them. That perpetuates predjudice and violence. That's NOT talking about things. That's NOT debate. If Dave Chapelle is a good friend of yours, try telling him his transphobia is baseless and he needs to change. I'm curious to know if you can reach him as you say \""we\"" can. If you want to talk to and reason with a person like Kanye West, you might as well go over to the nearest wall and bang your head on it. You'll end up with the same thing... getting nowhere with a very bad headache."",

He rules over the ten Nations of the Roman Empire.  The Country is the smallest in the world, and has its own flag and representatives in the UN, and other political bodies.  The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Churchbut also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope is a king and has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms(Daniel2:44,45)  Rome&#39;s image to represent it is the cross or X, which (X=10 in Latin)symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,&quot;get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her&quot;.  Revelation 18:4 Get out of her &quot;MY PEOPLE!&quot;\u003c/b\u003e  Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a Western backed coup, which forensic evidence told a different story than video evidence, so there was  a conspiracy.  \u003cb\u003eNATO supreme Commander Jan Staltenburg admitted NATO is behind the war on Russia and Ukraine. Western media renamed Ukraine Capital, changing it from it&#39;s Russian name, and the Russian language, history and culture were hidden and suppressed.  Those with out blue arm bands would be put to death by Ukrainian forces run by foreigners.  Zellensky says that Ukraine will become a Catholic State under the Pope, and that is why Roman Catholics Nancy Palosi and Joe Biden are supporting the war against Ukraine and Russia.\u003c/b\u003e  Imagine a Nation flying in to PEI(Prince Edward Island) Canada against Canada&#39;s wishes and saying they will supply them with unlimited arms to fight Canada.  Eighty five percent of the people of PEI don&#39;t want to separate.  Nancy Pellosi along with 5 aircraft battle groups arrive, and now 5+ Billion weapons deal. \u003cbr\u003e Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Countrybut part of Canada. The US and Japan are militarizing an Island near Taiwanbut NATO said they would attack the Soloman Islands if they militarize.(not if they attack, just militarizing). \u003cb\u003eJoe Biden says the US is not encouraging Taiwan to seperate(what? 5 billion+ in weapons).\u003c/b\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023.  WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a &quot;temporary&quot; measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  Universal income tax and printing money backed by faith in the beast has enabled Rome/UK/NATO to flourish.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it&#39;s use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. Religious people say follow Godbut in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  People are following Satan as if God.  Monopolies are broken upbut a church that God calls responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth isn&#39;t?  The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new variant =different form of information.  A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses and information.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  One is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  Two the second is a so called virus that attacks humans with signs of sneezing, head pain and breathlessness, like when a person is radiated or gassed. Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing death(zyklon b, suffocation).  Roman Catholic German Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. Technology is being exploited to do things that it is not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech. Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  \u003cb\u003eWe are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire.\u003c/b\u003e On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. \u003cb\u003eGog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars.\u003c/b\u003e  The Roman Pope says they control fiat currency system, and it could collapse soon. \u003cb\u003ePope 262 killed 6 days after announcing expos√© of the Roman Church.\u003c/b\u003e  German crematoriums running nonstop. \u003cb\u003eRead Daniel2:44,45, and Revelation 17,18 to understand the Monarchy!  WW2 started when British Monarchy reached the endbut imported a fake German Nazi  royal from Germany(Philip) to take the British Queens name(usually a woman takes a man&#39;s name). Now WW3 on account of that illegitimate combine&#39;s heir.  The Emporer has no cloths.\u003c/b\u003e  Ukraine violated the Minsk agreement along with NATO militarization and to hide the expos√© led to the war. \u003cb\u003eNATO is a terror Organization.\u003c/b\u003e  Ukraine was part of Russia before NATO coup and Russia would not bomb a powerplant that feeds their own Country power.  NATO? War on Ukraine and Russia?(Operation Barbarossa)  \u003cb\u003eHeavenly father I ask that you wipe 1/3 of all NATO ships from ocean, sea and lake, and make it known it is you.  Amen.(will God be sanctioned?\u003c/b\u003e The world should vote to disarm NATO, and take away the tax exemption of the Roman Churches.  \u003cb\u003eWhy is G7(Rome aligned) military spending more than all other Countries combined?\u003c/b\u003e  Catholic Poland had NATO military build up on Ukraine border before this war.(that is where most WW2 exterminations happened).  Poland said they were militarizing the border because of Russia. \u003cb\u003eBritain has military on their streets to keep the naked emperor in power(corona virus- crown -Boris stopped Ukraine peace talks-think).\u003c/b\u003e  Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo and other US officials mention in video, that the US would be waging war against China and Russia years in advance and before the invasion.  \u003cb\u003eDid Joe Biden and the US just commit the greatest act of terrorism in history for Rome, and admit it?\u003c/b\u003e  Catholic Poland thanks America for blowing up the pipeline, as they open a new pipeline from Norway.  \u003cb\u003ePeople need to realize the pipeline shutdown effects those not aligned with Rome, and that is why nothing makes sense until you know that.\u003c/b\u003e  The regions that voted to join Russia, previously voted to become independent but was not honored, and more would like to reunite.  NATO&#39;s emblem is the M.O.B(mark of the beast, same as emblem on Hitler&#39;s jacket, Modern German tanks)  WW2¬≤ as when Rome tried to exterminate Russia.(operation Barbarossa) Jan Staltenburg(NATO) and Retired US General Jack Keane confirm that the war is secretly on Russia by NATO proxy.  The Gog Magog war is a fraud, this is a war on Acts2:44 by Revelation17,18. All God loving Nations, Peoples, and Groups should prayerfully consider doing what ever God leads them to do!  You could be next.  Cars blown up from Russian missiles with no crater?  So Germany and Poland together again in the killing fields of WW2¬≤. !(??())"",

Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. Technology is being exploited to do things that it is not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech. Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  *We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire.* On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. *Gog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars.*  The Roman Pope says they control fiat currency system, and it could collapse soon. *Pope 262 killed 6 days after announcing expos√© of the Roman Church.*  German crematoriums running nonstop. *Read Daniel2:44,45, and Revelation 17,18 to understand the Monarchy!  WW2 started when British Monarchy reached the endbut imported a fake German Nazi  royal from Germany(Philip) to take the British Queens name(usually a woman takes a man's name). Now WW3 on account of that illegitimate combine's heir.  The Emporer has no cloths.*  Ukraine violated the Minsk agreement along with NATO militarization and to hide the expos√© led to the war. *NATO is a terror Organization.*  Ukraine was part of Russia before NATO coup and Russia would not bomb a powerplant that feeds their own Country power.  NATO? War on Ukraine and Russia?(Operation Barbarossa)  *Heavenly father I ask that you wipe 1/3 of all NATO ships from ocean, sea and lake, and make it known it is you.  Amen.(will God be sanctioned?* The world should vote to disarm NATO, and take away the tax exemption of the Roman Churches.  *Why is G7(Rome aligned) military spending more than all other Countries combined?*  Catholic Poland had NATO military build up on Ukraine border before this war.(that is where most WW2 exterminations happened).  Poland said they were militarizing the border because of Russia. *Britain has military on their streets to keep the naked emperor in power(corona virus- crown -Boris stopped Ukraine peace talks-think).*  Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo and other US officials mention in video, that the US would be waging war against China and Russia years in advance and before the invasion.  *Did Joe Biden and the US just commit the greatest act of terrorism in history for Rome, and admit it?*  Catholic Poland thanks America for blowing up the pipeline, as they open a new pipeline from Norway.  *People need to realize the pipeline shutdown effects those not aligned with Rome, and that is why nothing makes sense until you know that.*  The regions that voted to join Russia, previously voted to become independent but was not honored, and more would like to reunite.  NATO's emblem is the M.O.B(mark of the beast, same as emblem on Hitler's jacket, Modern German tanks)  WW2¬≤ as when Rome tried to exterminate Russia.(operation Barbarossa) Jan Staltenburg(NATO) and Retired US General Jack Keane confirm that the war is secretly on Russia by NATO proxy.  The Gog Magog war is a fraud, this is a war on Acts2:44 by Revelation17,18. All God loving Nations, Peoples, and Groups should prayerfully consider doing what ever God leads them to do!  You could be next.  Cars blown up from Russian missiles with no crater?  So Germany and Poland together again in the killing fields of WW2¬≤. !(??())"",

However, this was Top Secret information that should not have been top secret and that related to criminal activities of the US goverment in clear and unexcusable violation of both the normal law and the constitution. He tried to pass the information to those in charge before but nobody had a problem with the law breaking and there were no proper channels for wistleblowers in place. So the only choices he had were a) accepting that the constitutional rights and even human rights of millions of Ammericans (and even more foreigners in allied countries on top) are violated on a daily basis in blatend disregard for the law or b) break the law himself to publish this shit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe did b) and it was the right choice. It is worth mentioning that he did so in the most prudent way possible to not endanger any human intelligence sources. He worked only with a handfull of 100% trustworthy journalists - only the best of the best - and made them before agree to a very strict set of rules. Everything that was published was submitted to the NSA before publication. The NSA was given the opportunity to comment on potential endangerment of human intelligence sources and only in the absence of any reasonable concerns in this regards, publication took place. This was extremely careful and absolutely reasonable in my opinion. Compare this with the acitivities of Mr Assange - who in my opinion is an egocentric ... that puts his own publicity first and the interest of the people only second. He dumped tons of data without any checking and without any warning. This, in fact, did endanger human intelligence sources by a lot.

And for this, Dems and Republicans are equally at fault - Obama, Trump and Biden all failed to pardon him or commute his sentence to a reasonable one. While Trump is simply a morron that even things this is good, i think both Obama and Biden know/knew that what Snowden did was morally justified but did not pardon out of fear for political Backlash.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis forced Snowden to stay in Russia - although he clearly would have preferred to go back to the US. And thus, Snowden was under the control of Russia since then. He knows, if he says the wrong stuff or does not act in a way compatible with what Putin wants, he will be imprisoned or worse. He has nowhere to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yes, it is not right that he cooperates with Russia. But his only other choice would be to be imprisoned for the rest of his life ( by going back to the US) or to be killed (by acting anti-russian in russia). So doing the right thing would require him to become a Martyr, which he is not ready to do, which i can udnerstand. And why should he? He did a lot for the US Public to fight for their rights. The US Public, however, did a shit to then fight for him. So it is quite reasonable when he is disappointed. So why should he still be loyal to the US?

Comments are being suppressed, to cover up a genocide happening like during WW2.  News media no commenting =propaganda, which can&#39;t stand scrutiny(UK propaganda central).  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic and now under a corona virus /monkey pox pandemic.\u003c/b\u003e  It is not Russia or China spraying American skies in parallel lines.  It is not China or Russia venting gases to take your breath away in your dwellings.  \u003cb\u003eYou need a radiation detector and an air quality monitor with logging.\u003c/b\u003e  It usually happens at night while you sleep. \u003cb\u003eNATO is about to start a war with China, saying they attacked Taiwan.  Taiwan until very recently was acknowledged by the majority of all nations of the world as being part of China.  Taiwan has no embassy, as they are not a Country.  Recently changed in US documents in order to start the coming war.  The US has just passed a law like WW2, to supply endless weapons to Taiwan.  WW2 China was attacked from Taiwan after it&#39;s invasion by Japan.  Donald Trump told 3.5years in advance how the US would soon be waging war with Russia and China, and could not answer questions about corona virus because of the war.\u003c/b\u003e  All staged. \u003cb\u003eThe Pope is the King of the Vatican City State of Rome Italy.  He rules over the ten Nations of the Roman Empire.  The Country is the smallest in the world, and has its own flag and representatives in the UN, and other political bodies.  The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Churchbut also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms(Daniel2:44,45)  Rome&#39;s image to represent it is the cross or X, which (X=10 in Latin)symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,&quot;get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her&quot;.  Revelation 18:4 Get out of her &quot;MY PEOPLE!&quot;\u003c/b\u003e  The Red Cross is part of the Roman system masquerading as an aid organizationbut is military intelligence.  It has the (M.O.B.) mark of the beast as it&#39;s emblem.  Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a Western backed coup, which forensic evidence told a different story than video evidence, so there was  a conspiracy.  NATO supreme Commander Jan Staltenburg admitted NATO is behind the war on Russia and Ukraine. Western media changed the name of the Ukraine Capital from a Russian name to some thing else.  The Russian language, history and culture were hidden and suppressed.  Those with out blue arm bands would be put to death by Ukrainian forces run by foreigners.  Zellensky says that Ukraine will become a Catholic State under the Pope, and that is why Roman Catholics Nancy Palosi and Joe Biden are supporting the war against Ukraine and Russia.  \u003cb\u003eImagine a Nation flying in to PEI(Prince Edward Island) Canada against Canada&#39;s wishes and saying they will supply them with unlimited arms to fight Canada.  Eighty five percent of the people of PEI don&#39;t want to separate.  Nancy Pellosi along with 5 aircraft battle groups arrive, and now 5+ Billion weapons deal.  Well this is happeningbut not to PEIbut to Taiwan and China.  Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Countrybut part of Canada. The US and Japan are militarizing an Island near Taiwanbut NATO said they would attack the Soloman Islands if they militarize.(not if they attack, just militarizing). Joe Biden says the US is not encouraging Taiwan to seperate(what 5 billion+ in weapons).\u003c/b\u003e Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023 Executive Order 14067 sec#4 to control buying and selling.  WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a &quot;temporary&quot; measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  Universal income tax and printing money backed by faith in the beast has enabled Rome/UK/NATO to flourish.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it&#39;s use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. All the fraudulent leaders must keep Rome propped up to keep their own deceptive systems a float. Religious people say follow Godbut in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth.  God tells you there, what the leaders are wearing, \u003cb\u003eScarlet(Cardinals)\u003c/b\u003e and \u003cb\u003epurple(Bishops).\u003c/b\u003e  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  People are following Satan as if God.  Why tax exempt(Cowardly officials) Monopolies are broken upbut a church that God calls responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth.  The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new variant =different form of information.  A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  \u003cb\u003eOne\u003c/b\u003e is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  \u003cb\u003eTwo\u003c/b\u003e the second is a so called virus that attacks humans with signs of sneezing, head pain and breathlessness, like when a person is radiated or gassed. Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing death(zyklon b, suffocation).  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  Man can live for everbut it is being hid from you, by people who want to dominate and suppress you.  \u003cb\u003eThere are already technologies to heat and power cars and houses with out requiring any fuel.\u003c/b\u003e You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. \u003cbr\u003eTechnology is being exploited to do things that it is not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech. The government forces technogy to be breached by law enforcement, and then exploited for evil ends.  Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  Why did Nancy Pelosi by military escort breach a sovereign Nation&#39;s land where the microprocessor&#39;s are made?  Think!  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire. On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. \u003cb\u003eGog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars.\u003c/b\u003e The Roman Pope says they control fiat currencies, and every one should put their money in Church banks or the entire system could collapse, possibly by October. \u003cb\u003ePope 262 killed 6 days after announcing expos√© of the Roman Church.\u003c/b\u003e  German crematoriums running nonstop. \u003cb\u003eRead Daniel2:44,45, and Revelation 17,18 to understand the Monarchy!   WW2 started when British Monarchy reached the endbut imported a fake German Nazi  royal from Germany(Philip) to take the British Queens name(usually woman takes man&#39;s name). Now WW3 on account of that illegitimate combine&#39;s heir.  The Emporer has no cloths.\u003c/b\u003e  Ukraine violated the Minsk agreement along with NATO militarization and to hide the expos√© led to the war. NATO is a terror Organization.  Ukraine was part of Russia before NATO coup and Russia would not bomb a powerplant that feeds their own Country power.  NATO? War on Ukraine and Russia?(Operation Barbarossa)  Heavenly father I ask that you wipe 1/3 of all NATO ships from ocean, sea and lake, and make it known it is you.  Amen. \u003cb\u003eThe world should vote to disarm NATO, and take away the tax exemption of the Roman Churches.\u003c/b\u003e  Why is G7(Rome aligned) military spending more than all other Countries combined?  Catholic Poland had NATO military build up on Ukraine border before this war.(that is where most WW2 exterminations happened).  Poland said they were militarizing the border because of Russia. How will Rome deal with the Biblical year of Jubilee?  \u003cb\u003eBritain has military on their streets to keep the naked emperor in power(corona virus- crown -Boris stopped Ukraine peace talks-think).\u003c/b\u003e  Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo and other US officials mention in video, that the US would be waging war against China and Russia years in advance and before the invasion. ;+((+"",

A 390 nanometer light through a small hole in the top of a nontransparent enclosure filled with outside air, and sitting on the ground will show what is being sprayed on you!  Comments are being suppressed, to cover up a genocide happening like during WW2.  News media no commenting =propaganda, which can't stand scrutiny(UK propaganda central).  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic and now under a corona virus /monkey pox pandemic.*  It is not Russia or China spraying American skies in parallel lines.  It is not China or Russia venting gases to take your breath away in your dwellings.  *You need a radiation detector and an air quality monitor with logging.*  It usually happens at night while you sleep. *NATO is about to start a war with China, saying they attacked Taiwan.  Taiwan until very recently was acknowledged by the majority of all nations of the world as being part of China.  Taiwan has no embassy, as they are not a Country.  Recently changed in US documents in order to start the coming war.  The US has just passed a law like WW2, to supply endless weapons to Taiwan.  WW2 China was attacked from Taiwan after it's invasion by Japan.  Donald Trump told 3.5years in advance how the US would soon be waging war with Russia and China, and could not answer questions about corona virus because of the war.*  All staged. *The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State of Rome Italy.  He rules over the ten Nations of the Roman Empire.  The Country is the smallest in the world, and has its own flag and representatives in the UN, and other political bodies.  The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Churchbut also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms(Daniel2:44,45)  Rome's image to represent it is the cross or X, which (X=10 in Latin)symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,\""get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her\"".  Revelation 18:4 Get out of her \""MY PEOPLE!\""*  The Red Cross is part of the Roman system masquerading as an aid organizationbut is military intelligence.

Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic and now under a corona virus /monkey pox pandemic.\u003c/b\u003e  It is not Russia or China spraying American skies in parallel lines.  It is not China or Russia venting gases to take your breath away in your dwellings.  \u003cb\u003eYou need a radiation detector and an air quality monitor with logging.\u003c/b\u003e  It usually happens at night while you sleep. \u003cb\u003eNATO is about to start a war with China, saying they attacked Taiwan.  Taiwan until very recently was acknowledged by the majority of all nations of the world as being part of China.  Taiwan has no embassy, as they are not a Country.  Recently changed in US documents in order to start the coming war.  The US has just passed a law like WW2, to supply endless weapons to Taiwan.  WW2 China was attacked from Taiwan after it&#39;s invasion by Japan.  Donald Trump told 3.5years in advance how the US would soon be waging war with Russia and China, and could not answer questions about corona virus because of the war.\u003c/b\u003e  All staged. \u003cb\u003eThe Pope is the King of the Vatican City State of Rome Italy.  He rules over the ten Nations of the Roman Empire.  The Country is the smallest in the world, and has its own flag and representatives in the UN, and other political bodies.  The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Churchbut also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms(Daniel2:44,45)  Rome&#39;s image to represent it is the cross or X, which (X=10 in Latin)symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,&quot;get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her&quot;.  Revelation 18:4 Get out of her &quot;MY PEOPLE!&quot;\u003c/b\u003e  The Red Cross is part of the Roman system masquerading as an aid organizationbut is military intelligence.  It has the (M.O.B.) mark of the beast as it&#39;s emblem.  Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a Western backed coup, which forensic evidence told a different story than video evidence, so there was  a conspiracy.  NATO supreme Commander Jan Staltenburg admitted NATO is behind the war on Russia and Ukraine. Western media changed the name of the Ukraine Capital from a Russian name to some thing else.  The Russian language, history and culture were hidden and suppressed.  Those with out blue arm bands would be put to death by Ukrainian forces run by foreigners.  Zellensky says that Ukraine will become a Catholic State under the Pope, and that is why Roman Catholics Nancy Palosi and Joe Biden are supporting the war against Ukraine and Russia.  \u003cb\u003eImagine a Nation flying in to PEI(Prince Edward Island) Canada against Canada&#39;s wishes and saying they will supply them with unlimited arms to fight Canada.  Eighty five percent of the people of PEI don&#39;t want to separate.  Nancy Pellosi along with 5 aircraft battle groups arrive, and now 5+ Billion weapons deal.  Well this is happeningbut not to PEIbut to Taiwan and China.  Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Countrybut part of Canada. The US and Japan are militarizing an Island near Taiwanbut NATO said they would attack the Soloman Islands if they militarize.(not if they attack, just militarizing). Joe Biden says the US is not encouraging Taiwan to seperate(what 5 billion+ in weapons).\u003c/b\u003e Truth can stand on it&#39;s own two feetbut lies have to be propped up. Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023 Executive Order 14067 sec#4 to control buying and selling.  WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a &quot;temporary&quot; measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  Universal income tax and printing money backed by faith in the beast has enabled Rome/UK/NATO to flourish.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it&#39;s use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. All the fraudulent leaders must keep Rome propped up to keep their own deceptive systems a float. Religious people say follow Godbut in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth.  God tells you there, what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  People are following Satan as if God.  Why tax exempt(Cowardly officials) Monopolies are broken upbut a church that God calls responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth.  The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new variant =different form of information.  A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  \u003cb\u003eOne is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  Two the second is a so called virus that attacks humans with signs of sneezing, head pain and breathlessness, like when a person is radiated or gassed. Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing death(zyklon b, suffocation).  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  Man can live for everbut it is being hid from you, by people who want to dominate and suppress you.  *There are already technologies to heat and power cars and houses with out requiring any fuel.\u003c/b\u003e You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. \u003cbr\u003eTechnology is being exploited to do things that it is not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech. The government forces technogy to be breached by law enforcement, and then exploited for evil ends.  Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  Why did Nancy Pelosi by military escort breach a sovereign Nation&#39;s land where the microprocessor&#39;s are made?  Think!  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire. On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. \u003cb\u003eGog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars.\u003c/b\u003e The Roman Pope says they control fiat currencies, and church members should be willing to lose every thing to prop up fiat currencies, and have till end of the month or are considered separated from the church. Christian financiers associated with Rome say possible collapse before October.  \u003cb\u003ePope 262 killed 6 days after announcing expos√© of the Roman Church.\u003c/b\u003e  German crematoriums running nonstop. \u003cb\u003eRead Daniel2:44,45, and Revelation 17,18 to understand the Monarchy!   WW2 started when British Monarchy reached the endbut imported a fake German Nazi  royal from Germany(Philip) to take the British Queens name(usually woman takes man&#39;s name). Now WW3 on account of that illegitimate combine&#39;s heir.  The Emporer has no cloths.\u003c/b\u003e  Ukraine violated the Minsk agreement along with NATO militarization and to hide the expos√© led to the war. NATO is a terror Organization.  Ukraine was part of Russia before NATO coup and Russia would not bomb a powerplant that feeds their own Country power.  NATO? War on Ukraine and Russia?(Operation Barbarossa)  Heavenly father I ask that you wipe 1/3 of all NATO ships from ocean, sea and lake, and make it known it is you.  Amen. \u003cb\u003eThe world should vote to disarm NATO, and take away the tax exemption of the Roman Churches.\u003c/b\u003e  Why is G7 military spending more than all other Countries combined?  \u003cb\u003eGermany about to expose the Pope September 24, world shaking, have your camera and recorder ready!\u003c/b\u003e  Catholic Poland had NATO military build up on Ukraine border before this war.(that is where most WW2 exterminations happened).

Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. *Gog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars.* The Roman Pope says they control fiat currencies, and church members should be willing to lose every thing to prop up fiat currencies, and have till end of the month or are considered separated from the church. Christian financiers associated with Rome say possible collapse before October.  *Pope 262 killed 6 days after announcing expos√© of the Roman Church.*  German crematoriums running nonstop. *Read Daniel2:44,45, and Revelation 17,18 to understand the Monarchy!   WW2 started when British Monarchy reached the endbut imported a fake German Nazi  royal from Germany(Philip) to take the British Queens name(usually woman takes man's name). Now WW3 on account of that illegitimate combine's heir.  The Emporer has no cloths.*  Ukraine violated the Minsk agreement along with NATO militarization and to hide the expos√© led to the war. NATO is a terror Organization.  Ukraine was part of Russia before NATO coup and Russia would not bomb a powerplant that feeds their own Country power.  NATO? War on Ukraine and Russia?(Operation Barbarossa)  Heavenly father I ask that you wipe 1/3 of all NATO ships from ocean, sea and lake, and make it known it is you.  Amen. *The world should vote to disarm NATO, and take away the tax exemption of the Roman Churches.*  Why is G7 military spending more than all other Countries combined?  *Germany about to expose the Pope September 24, world shaking, have your camera and recorder ready!*  Catholic Poland had NATO military build up on Ukraine border before this war.(that is where most WW2 exterminations happened).  Poland said they were militarizing the border because of Russia. !+?':))"",

WW2 China was attacked from Taiwan after it&#39;s invasion by Japan.

The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Churchbut also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms(Daniel2:44,45)  Rome&#39;s image to represent it is the cross or X, which (X=10 in Latin)symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,&quot;get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her&quot;.  Revelation 18:4 Get out of her &quot;MY PEOPLE!&quot;\u003c/b\u003e  The Red Cross is part of the Roman system masquerading as an aid organizationbut is military intelligence.  It has the (M.O.B.) mark of the beast as it&#39;s emblem.  Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a Western backed coup, which forensic evidence told a different story than video evidence, so there was  a conspiracy.  NATO supreme Commander Jan Staltenburg admitted NATO is behind the war on Russia and Ukraine. Western media changed the name of the Ukraine Capital from a Russian name to some thing else.  The Russian language, history and culture were hidden and suppressed.  Those with out blue arm bands would be put to death by Ukrainian forces run by foreigners.  Zellensky says that Ukraine will become a Catholic State under the Pope, and that is why Roman Catholics Nancy Palosi and Joe Biden are supporting the war against Ukraine and Russia.  \u003cb\u003eImagine a Nation flying in to PEI(Prince Edward Island) Canada against Canada&#39;s wishes and saying they will supply them with unlimited arms to fight Canada.  Eighty five percent of the people of PEI don&#39;t want to separate.  Nancy Pellosi along with 5 aircraft battle groups arrive, and now 5+ Billion weapons deal.  Well this is happeningbut not to PEIbut to Taiwan and China.  Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Countrybut part of Canada. The US and Japan are militarizing an Island near Taiwanbut NATO said they would attack the Soloman Islands if they militarize.(not if they attack, just militarizing). Joe Biden says the US is not encouraging Taiwan to seperate(what 5 billion+ in weapons).\u003c/b\u003e Truth can stand on it&#39;s own two feetbut lies have to be propped up. Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023 Executive Order 14067 sec#4 to control buying and selling.  WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a &quot;temporary&quot; measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  Universal income tax and printing money backed by faith in the beast has enabled Rome/UK/NATO to flourish.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it&#39;s use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. All the fraudulent leaders must keep Rome propped up to keep their own deceptive systems a float. Religious people say follow Godbut in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth.  God tells you there, what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  People are following Satan as if God.  Why tax exempt(Cowardly officials) Monopolies are broken upbut a church that God calls responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth.  The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new variant =different form of information.  A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  \u003cb\u003eOne is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  Two the second is a so called virus that attacks humans with signs of sneezing, head pain and breathlessness, like when a person is radiated or gassed. Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing death(zyklon b, suffocation).  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  Man can live for everbut it is being hid from you, by people who want to dominate and suppress you.  *There are already technologies to heat and power cars and houses with out requiring any fuel.\u003c/b\u003e You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. \u003cbr\u003eTechnology is being exploited to do things that it is not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech. The government forces technogy to be breached by law enforcement, and then exploited for evil ends.  Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  Why did Nancy Pelosi by military escort breach a sovereign Nation&#39;s land where the microprocessor&#39;s are made?  Think!  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire. On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.

Universal income tax and printing money backed by faith in the beast has enabled Rome/UK/NATO to flourish.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it's use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. All the fraudulent leaders must keep Rome propped up to keep their own deceptive systems a float. Religious people say follow Godbut in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth.  God tells you there, what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  People are following Satan as if God.  Why tax exempt(Cowardly officials) Monopolies are broken upbut a church that God calls responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth.  The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new variant =different form of information.  A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  *One is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.

Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing death(zyklon b, suffocation).  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  Man can live for everbut it is being hid from you, by people who want to dominate and suppress you.  *There are already technologies to heat and power cars and houses with out requiring any fuel.* You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. \nTechnology is being exploited to do things that it is not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech. The government forces technogy to be breached by law enforcement, and then exploited for evil ends.  Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  Why did Nancy Pelosi by military escort breach a sovereign Nation's land where the microprocessor's are made?  Think!  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire. On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. *Gog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).

Christian financiers associated with Rome say possible collapse before October.  *Pope 262 killed 6 days after announcing expos√© of the Roman Church.*  German crematoriums running nonstop. *Read Daniel2:44,45, and Revelation 17,18 to understand the Monarchy!   WW2 started when British Monarchy reached the endbut imported a fake German Nazi  royal from Germany(Philip) to take the British Queens name(usually woman takes man's name). Now WW3 on account of that illegitimate combine's heir.  The Emporer has no cloths.*  Ukraine violated the Minsk agreement along with NATO militarization and to hide the expos√© led to the war. NATO is a terror Organization.  Ukraine was part of Russia before NATO coup and Russia would not bomb a powerplant that feeds their own Country power.  NATO? War on Ukraine and Russia?(Operation Barbarossa)  Heavenly father I ask that you wipe 1/3 of all NATO ships from ocean, sea and lake, and make it known it is you.  Amen. *The world should vote to disarm NATO, and take away the tax exemption of the Roman Churches.*  Why is G7 military spending more than all other Countries combined?  *Germany about to expose the Pope September 24, world shaking, have your camera and recorder ready!*  Google and YouTube have brought more knowledge and information to better people's lives than any thing in history, accepted the Bible.

It is not Russia or China spraying American skies in parallel lines.  It is not China or Russia venting gases to take your breath away in your dwellings.  You need a radiation detector and an air quality monitor with logging.  It usually happens at night while you sleep. NATO is about to start a war with China, saying they attacked Taiwan.  Taiwan until very recently was acknowledged by the majority of all nations of the world as being part of China.  Taiwan has no embassy, as they are not a Country.  Recently changed in US documents in order to start the coming war.  The US has just passed a law like WW2, to supply endless weapons to Taiwan.  WW2 China was attacked from Taiwan after it&#39;s invasion by Japan.  Donald Trump told 3.5years in advance how the US would soon be waging war with Russia and China, and could not answer questions about corona virus because of the war.\u003c/b\u003e  All staged. \u003cb\u003eThe Pope is the King of the Vatican City State of Rome Italy.  He rules over the ten Nations of the Roman Empire.  The Country is the smallest in the world, and has its own flag and representatives in the UN, and other political bodies.  The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Churchbut also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms(Daniel2:44,45)  Rome&#39;s image to represent it is the cross or X, which (X=10 in Latin)symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,&quot;get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her&quot;.  Revelation 18:4 Get out of her &quot;MY PEOPLE!&quot;\u003c/b\u003e  The Red Cross is part of the Roman system masquerading as an aid organizationbut is military intelligence.  It has the (M.O.B.) mark of the beast as it&#39;s emblem.  \u003cb\u003eUkraine was part of the Russian Federation until a Western backed coup, which forensic evidence told a different story than video evidence, so there was  a conspiracy.  NATO supreme Commander Jan Staltenburg admitted NATO is behind the war on Russia and Ukraine. Western media changed the name of the Ukraine Capital from a Russian name to some thing else.  The Russian language, history and culture were hidden and suppressed.  Those with out blue arm bands would be put to death by Ukrainian forces run by foreigners.  Zellensky says that Ukraine will become a Catholic State under the Pope, and that is why Roman Catholics Nancy Palosi and Joe Biden are supporting the war against Ukraine and Russia.\u003c/b\u003e  Imagine a Nation flying in to PEI(Prince Edward Island) Canada against Canada&#39;s wishes and saying they will supply them with unlimited arms to fight Canada.  Eighty five percent of the people of PEI don&#39;t want to separate. The Nation sends military jets of theirs and Japan&#39;s to escort a woman to PEI to stir things up, along with 5 aircraft carrier battle groups. Imagine that!  Or what if this happened to Alaska?  Well this is happeningbut not to PEIbut to Taiwan and China.  Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Countrybut part of Canada. The US and Japan are militarizing an Island near Taiwanbut NATO said they would attack the Soloman Islands if they militarize.(not if they attack, just militarizing) These wars are to hide Revelation 17,18&#39;s identity, and to distract you from the 1918/WW2 like genocide.  Comments are being edited by G7 Nations.(security reasons). Truth can stand on it&#39;s own two feetbut lies have to be propped up. Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023 Executive Order 14067 sec#4 to control buying and selling.  WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a &quot;temporary&quot; measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  Universal income tax and printing money backed by faith in the beast has enabled Rome/UK/NATO to flourish.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it&#39;s use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. All the fraudulent leaders must keep Rome propped up to keep their own deceptive systems a float. Religious people say follow Godbut in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth.  God tells you there, what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  People are following Satan as if God.  Why tax exempt(Cowardly officials) Monopolies are broken upbut a church that God calls responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth.  Obviously they do not really believe in God.  They don&#39;t even know his name. The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new variant =different form of information.  A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  *One is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  Two the second is a so called virus that attacks humans with signs of sneezing, head pain and breathlessness, like when a person is radiated or gassed. Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing death(zyklon b, suffocation).  Look in to the sky and you will see planes spraying the sky in parallel patterns, just before an outbreak. Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  Man can live for everbut it is being hid from you, by people who want to dominate and suppress you.  There are already technologies to heat and power cars and houses with out requiring any fuel. You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. \u003cbr\u003eTechnology is being exploited to do things that it is not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech. The government forces technogy to be breached by law enforcement, and then exploited for evil ends.  Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  Why did Nancy Pelosi by military escort breach a sovereign Nation&#39;s land where the microprocessor&#39;s are made?  Think!  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire. On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. Gog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars. The Roman Pope says they control fiat currencies, and church members should be willing to lose every thing to prop up fiat currencies, and have till end of the month or are considered separated from the church. Christian financiers associated with Rome say possible collapse before October.  Pope 262 killed 6 days after announcing expos√© of the Roman Church.  German crematoriums running nonstop. Read Daniel2:44,45, and Revelation 17,18 to understand the Monarchy!   WW2 started when British Monarchy reached the endbut imported a fake German Nazi  royal from Germany(Philip) to take the British Queens name. Now WW3 after that illegitimate combine.  The Emporer has no cloths. Ukraine violated the Minsk agreement along with NATO militarization led to the war. NATO is a terror Organization.  Ukraine was part of Russia before NATO coup and Russia would not bomb a powerplant that feeds their own Country&#39;s power.  NATO? War on Ukraine and Russia?(Operation Barbarossa)  Heavenly father I ask that you wipe 1/3 of all NATO ships from ocean, sea and lake, and make it known it is you.  Amen. Headquarters of Rome was Constantinople (now Istanbul) previously, and now attacking Armenia through Azerbaijan.

You need a radiation detector and an air quality monitor with logging.  It usually happens at night while you sleep. NATO is about to start a war with China, saying they attacked Taiwan.  Taiwan until very recently was acknowledged by the majority of all nations of the world as being part of China.  Taiwan has no embassy, as they are not a Country.  Recently changed in US documents in order to start the coming war.  The US has just passed a law like WW2, to supply endless weapons to Taiwan.  WW2 China was attacked from Taiwan after it&#39;s invasion by Japan.

He rules over the ten Nations of the Roman Empire.  The Country is the smallest in the world, and has its own flag and representatives in the UN, and other political bodies.  The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Churchbut also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms(Daniel2:44,45)  Rome&#39;s image to represent it is the cross or X, which (X=10 in Latin)symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,&quot;get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her&quot;.  Revelation 18:4 Get out of her &quot;MY PEOPLE!&quot;\u003c/b\u003e  The Red Cross is part of the Roman system masquerading as an aid organizationbut is military intelligence.  It has the (M.O.B.) mark of the beast as it&#39;s emblem.  \u003cb\u003eUkraine was part of the Russian Federation until a Western backed coup, which forensic evidence told a different story than video evidence, so there was  a conspiracy.  NATO supreme Commander Jan Staltenburg admitted NATO is behind the war on Russia and Ukraine. Western media changed the name of the Ukraine Capital from a Russian name to some thing else.  The Russian language, history and culture were hidden and suppressed.  Those with out blue arm bands would be put to death by Ukrainian forces run by foreigners.  Zellensky says that Ukraine will become a Catholic State under the Pope, and that is why Roman Catholics Nancy Palosi and Joe Biden are supporting the war against Ukraine and Russia.\u003c/b\u003e  Imagine a Nation flying in to PEI(Prince Edward Island) Canada against Canada&#39;s wishes and saying they will supply them with unlimited arms to fight Canada.  Eighty five percent of the people of PEI don&#39;t want to separate. The Nation sends military jets of theirs and Japan&#39;s to escort a woman to PEI to stir things up, along with 5 aircraft carrier battle groups. Imagine that!  Or what if this happened to Alaska?  Well this is happeningbut not to PEIbut to Taiwan and China.  Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Countrybut part of Canada. The US and Japan are militarizing an Island near Taiwanbut NATO said they would attack the Soloman Islands if they militarize.(not if they attack, just militarizing) These wars are to hide Revelation 17,18&#39;s identity, and to distract you from the 1918/WW2 like genocide.  Comments are being edited by G7 Nations.(security reasons). Truth can stand on it&#39;s own two feetbut lies have to be propped up. Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023 Executive Order 14067 sec#4 to control buying and selling.  WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a &quot;temporary&quot; measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  Universal income tax and printing money backed by faith in the beast has enabled Rome/UK/NATO to flourish.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it&#39;s use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. All the fraudulent leaders must keep Rome propped up to keep their own deceptive systems a float. Religious people say follow Godbut in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth.  God tells you there, what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  People are following Satan as if God.  Why tax exempt(Cowardly officials) Monopolies are broken upbut a church that God calls responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth.  Obviously they do not really believe in God.  They don&#39;t even know his name. The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new variant =different form of information.  A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  *One is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  Two the second is a so called virus that attacks humans with signs of sneezing, head pain and breathlessness, like when a person is radiated or gassed. Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing death(zyklon b, suffocation).  Look in to the sky and you will see planes spraying the sky in parallel patterns, just before an outbreak. Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  Man can live for everbut it is being hid from you, by people who want to dominate and suppress you.  There are already technologies to heat and power cars and houses with out requiring any fuel. You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. \u003cbr\u003eTechnology is being exploited to do things that it is not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech. The government forces technogy to be breached by law enforcement, and then exploited for evil ends.  Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  Why did Nancy Pelosi by military escort breach a sovereign Nation&#39;s land where the microprocessor&#39;s are made?  Think!  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire. On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. Gog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars. The Roman Pope says they control fiat currencies, and church members should be willing to lose every thing to prop up fiat currencies, and have till end of the month or are considered separated from the church. Christian financiers associated with Rome say possible collapse before October.  Pope 262 killed 6 days after announcing expos√© of the Roman Church.  German crematoriums running nonstop. Read Daniel2:44,45, and Revelation 17,18 to understand the Monarchy!   WW2 started when British Monarchy reached the endbut imported a fake German Nazi  royal from Germany(Philip) to take the British Queens name. Now WW3 after that illegitimate combine.  The Emporer has no cloths. Ukraine violated the Minsk agreement along with NATO militarization led to the war. NATO is a terror Organization.  Ukraine was part of Russia before NATO coup and Russia would not bomb a powerplant that feeds their own Country&#39;s power.  NATO? War on Ukraine and Russia?  Heavenly father I ask that you wipe 1/3 of all NATO ships from ocean, sea and lake, and make it known it is you.  Amen. Headquarters of Rome was Constantinople (now Istanbul) previously, and now attacking Armenia through Azerbaijan.  The world should vote to disarm NATO, and take away the tax exemption of the Roman Churches. !?!)??("",

God tells you there, what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  People are following Satan as if God.  Why tax exempt(Cowardly officials) Monopolies are broken upbut a church that God calls responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth.  Obviously they do not really believe in God.  They don&#39;t even know his name. The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new variant =different form of information.  A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  *One is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  Two the second is a so called virus that attacks humans with signs of sneezing, head pain and breathlessness, like when a person is radiated or gassed. Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing death(zyklon b, suffocation).  Look in to the sky and you will see planes spraying the sky in parallel patterns, just before an outbreak. Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  Man can live for everbut it is being hid from you, by people who want to dominate and suppress you.  There are already technologies to heat and power cars and houses with out requiring any fuel. You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. \u003cbr\u003eTechnology is being exploited to do things that it is not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech. The government forces technogy to be breached by law enforcement, and then exploited for evil ends.  Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  Why did Nancy Pelosi by military escort breach a sovereign Nation&#39;s land where the microprocessor&#39;s are made?  Think!  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire.  Look at early 15th century Magna Carta documents where it talks how Rome will pay back for the wholesale slaughter of populations.  It says to lock them down then go in and exterminate. On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. Gog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars. The Roman Pope says they control fiat currencies, and church members should be willing to lose every thing to prop up fiat currencies, and have till end of the month or are considered separated from the church. Christian financiers associated with Rome say possible collapse before October.  Pope 262 killed 6 days after announcing expos√© of the Roman Church.  German crematoriums running nonstop. Read Daniel2:44,45, and Revelation 17,18 to understand the Monarchy!   WW2 started when British Monarchy reached the endbut imported a fake German Nazi  royal from Germany(Philip) to take the British Queens name. Now WW3 after that illegitimate combine.  The Emporer has no cloths. Ukraine violated the Minsk agreement along with NATO militarization led to the war. NATO is a terror Organization.  Ukraine was part of Russia before NATO coup and Russia would not bomb a powerplant that feeds their own Country&#39;s power.  NATO? War on Ukraine and Russia?  Heavenly father I ask that you wipe 1/3 of all NATO ships from ocean, sea and lake, and make it known it is you.  Amen.

Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  People are following Satan as if God.  Why tax exempt(Cowardly officials) The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new variant =different form of information.  A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  *One is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  Two the second is a so called virus that attacks humans with signs of sneezing, head pain and breathlessness, like when a person is radiated or gassed. Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing them to sneeze and eventually die(zyklon b, causing suffocation).  Look in to the sky and you will see planes spraying the sky in parallel patterns, just before an outbreak. Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  Man can live for everbut it is being hid from you, by people who want to dominate and suppress you.  There are already technologies to heat and power cars and houses with out requiring any fuel. You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. \u003cbr\u003eTechnology is being exploited to do things that it is not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech. The government forces technogy to be breached by law enforcement, and then exploited for evil ends.  Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  Why did Nancy Pelosi by military escort breach a sovereign Nation&#39;s land where the microprocessor&#39;s are made?  Think!  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire.  Look at early 15th century Magna Carta documents where it talks how Rome will pay back for the wholesale slaughter of populations.  It says to lock them down then go in and exterminate.  \u200bIt was done under the guise of a typhus epidemic by Austrian/German(Austrian Catholics secretly control Germany) Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler during WW2, and now they are doing it under a corona virus pandemic/ monkey pox pandemic. On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Russia built and controls the nuclear power plant and would not bomb themselves. Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. Gog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars. The Roman Pope says they control fiat currencies, and church members should be willing to lose every thing to prop up fiat currencies, and have till end of the month or are considered separated from the church. Christian financiers associated with Rome say possible collapse before October.  Pope 262 killed 6 days after announcing expos√© of the Roman Church.  German crematoriums running nonstop.  Pope visited Canada, admitted genocide, then 12 Native Americans were dead and a supposed man hunt for Native Americans. NAZ!S. Killing all with out blue arm bands. Think!  Read Daniel2:44,45, and Revelation 17,18 to understand the Monarchy!   WW2 started when British Monarchy reached the endbut imported a fake German Nazi  royal from Germany(Philip) to take the British Queens name. Now WW3 as illegitimate son takes control.

Eighty five percent of the people of PEI don't want to separate.  Germany sends military jets of theirs and Japan's to escort a woman to PEI to stir this up, along with 5 aircraft carrier battle groups. Imagine that!  Or what if this happened to Alaska?  Well this is happeningbut not to PEIbut to Taiwan and China.  Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Countrybut part of Canada. The US and Japan are militarizing an Island near Taiwanbut NATO said they would attack the Soloman Islands if they militarize.(not if they attack, just militarizing) These wars are to hide Revelation 17,18's identity, and to distract you from the 1918/WW2 like genocide.  Comments are being edited by G7 Nations.(security reasons). Truth can stand on it's own two feetbut lies have to be propped up. Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023 Executive Order 14067 sec#4 to control buying and selling.  WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a \""temporary\"" measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  Universal income tax and printing money backed by faith in the beast has enabled Rome/UK/NATO to flourish.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it's use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. All the fraudulent leaders must keep Rome propped up to keep their own deceptive systems a float.

The US and Japan are militarizing an Island near Taiwanbut NATO said they would attack the Soloman Islands if they militarize.(not if they attack, just militarizing) These wars are to hide Revelation 17,18&#39;s identity, and to distract you from the 1918/WW2 like genocide.  Comments are being edited by G7 Nations.(security reasons). Truth can stand on it&#39;s own two feetbut lies have to be propped up. Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023 Executive Order 14067 sec#4 to control buying and selling.  WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a &quot;temporary&quot; measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it&#39;s use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. 85% of Taiwanese want to remain a part of China. All the fraudulent leaders must keep Rome propped up to keep their own deceptive systems a float. Religious people say follow Godbut in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth.  God tells you there, what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  People are following Satan as if God.  Why tax exempt(Cowardly officials) The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new name =different avenue of attack.   A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  *One\u003c/b\u003e is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  \u003cb\u003eTwo\u003c/b\u003e the second is a so called virus that attacks humans with signs of sneezing, head pain and breathlessness, like when a person is radiated or gassed. Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing them to sneeze and eventually die(zyklon b, causing suffocation).  Look in to the sky and you will see planes spraying the sky in parallel patterns, just before an outbreak. Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  Man can live for everbut it is being hid from you, by people who want to dominate and suppress you.  There are already technologies to heat and power cars and houses with out requiring any fuel. You can start a car with a key lawfullybut you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. \u003cbr\u003eTechnology is  being exploited to do things that are not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech because it is doing some thing it is not supposed to.  The government forces technogy to be breached by law enforcement, and then exploited for evil ends.  Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  They are trying to shut down microprocessor production.  Why did Nancy Pelosi by military escort breach a sovereign Nation&#39;s land where the microprocessor&#39;s are made?  Think!  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire.  Look at early 15th century Magna Carta documents where it talks how Rome will pay back for the wholesale slaughter of populations.  It says to lock them down then go in and exterminate.  \u200bIt was done under the guise of a typhus epidemic by Austrian/German Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler during WW2, and now they are doing it under a corona virus pandemic/ monkey pox pandemic. On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Russia built and controls the nuclear power plant and would not bomb themselves. Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. Gog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars. The Roman Pope says they control fiat currencies, and church members should be willing to lose every thing to prop up fiat currencies, and have till end of the month or are considered separated from the church. Collapse coming quickly.  Heavenly father, I ask that you wipe 1/3 of all NATO ships from ocean, sea and lake, and make it known that it is you doing it!  You rule  Amen  UK seizing bank accounts. ;+(?("",
            ""textOriginal"": ""*Those being sprayed. Shine a 390 nanometer light(black light) through a one inch hole in the top of a large cardboard box filled with outside air, and sitting on the ground to see what is being sprayed on you! Post it!  Comments are being suppressed, to cover up a genocide happening like during WW2, news media no commenting =propaganda, which can't stand scrutiny(UK propaganda central).  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic and now under a corona virus /monkey pox pandemic.  It is not Russia or China spraying American skies in parallel lines.  It is not China or Russia venting gases to take your breath away in your dwellings.  You need a radiation detector and an air quality monitor with logging.  It usually happens at night while you sleep and you probably don't even know.  Vaccines(Computer vaccines) hide information from you.  When you think that they are talking about real viruses, they are actually taking about electronic generated information that they must suppress by forcing a computer anti virus signature that looks for information and deletes it from your view. NATO is the military arm of Revelation17,18, and is about to start a war with China, saying they attacked Taiwan.  Taiwan until very recently was acknowledged by the majority of all nations of the world as being part of China.  Taiwan has no embassy, as they are not a Country.  It was just recently changed on US documents in order to start the coming war.  The US has just passed a law similar to the one during WW2, to supply endless weapons to Taiwan.  WW2 China was attacked from Taiwan after it's invasion by Japan.  Donald Trump told 3.5years in advance how the US would soon be waging war with Russia and China.  This is all staged by Rome.  The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State of Rome Italy.  He rules over the soon to be ten Nations of the Roman Empire.  The Country is the smallest in the world, and has its own flag and representatives in the UN, and other political bodies.  The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Churchbut also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms.  Empires in the Bible are referred to as beasts, and Rome's image to represent it is the cross or X, which symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,\""get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her\"". Revelation 18:4 Get out of her \""MY PEOPLE!\""  The Red Cross is part of the Roman system masquerading as an aid organizationbut is military intelligence.  It has the (M.O.B.) mark of the beast as it's emblem.   Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a Western backed coup in 2014, which forensic evidence told a different story than video evidence, so there was  a conspiracy.  NATO supreme Commander Jan Staltenburg admitted NATO is behind the war on Russia and Ukraine. Western media changed the name of the Ukraine Capital from a Russian name to some thing else.  The Russian language, history and culture were hidden and suppressed.  Those with out blue arm bands would be put to death by Ukrainian forces run by foreigners.  Zellensky says that Ukraine will become a Catholic State under the Pope, and that is why Roman Catholics Nancy Palosi and Joe Biden are supporting the war against Ukraine and Russia.  Imagine Germany flying in to PEI(Prince Edward Island) Canada against Canada's wishes and saying they will supply them with unlimited arms to fight Canada.  Eighty five percent of the people of PEI don't want to separate.  Then Germany says that Canada is flying over PEI's air space, and makes the world think that Canada is violating PEI. Germany sends military jets of theirs and Japan's to escort a woman to PEI to stir this up, a long with 5 aircraft carrier battle groups. Imagine that!  Or what if this happened to Alaska?  Well this is happeningbut not to PEIbut to Taiwan and China.  Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Countrybut part of Canada. The US and Japan are militarizing an Island near Taiwanbut NATO said they would attack the Soloman Islands if they militarize.(not if they attack, just militarizing) These wars are to hide Revelation 17,18's identity, and to distract you from the 1918/WW2 like genocide.

The most important thing to him was the loss of his 135 million dollar fortune he would forfeit if convicted. Do you see him shedding any tears whatsoever, he is not truly remorseful, and it sickens me he was allowed back into the NFL after his &quot;horrific acts&quot;, in the words of James Brown himself.

We invested in this couple for decades despite the fact that baby bell only seems to know how to write one type of story-one where ultimately the sanctimonious Logan&#39;s with their situational ethics ALWAYS COME ON TOP. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor perspective Taylor kept the lie for all off 5 minutes based on ridge&#39;s words and a desire to shield her son. Taylor didn&#39;t put the lie i to motion or advance the lie over time (that was Thomas after watching brooke play with his father&#39;s heart for the better part of the year and after watching his father toy with his mothers heart for the better part of the year), Taylor never forced Ridge to get on a plane, Taylor never forced Brooke to repeatedly smear Thomas and to threaten the very call to Cps that he would later fake in an effort to prevent Thomas from reclaiming custody of his rightful son, and Taylor never pressured ridge to swear that he should have come back to Taylor sooner let alone to propose marriage, yeah it&#39;s pretty clear that they&#39;re setting her up to be the scapegoat for much of it and of course she&#39;ll pay the price. Krista Allen was a phenomenal find for the recast role and her chemistry with Thorsten Kaye is electric, particularly when compared to that between him and KKL, who has far more chemistry with Don diamont IMHO. If all they were ever going to write is the dysfunctional back-and-forth with Bridge why didn&#39;t they just let Bridge be dysfunctional and let Taylor move on the back when he fell for the phony &quot;I can&#39;t take care of myself because I have a bad ankle,&quot; mealy-mouthed Brooke story They had playing out six months ago? Did they recast the role just to have a foil with which to prop up interest in the tired Bridge pairing? Who wants to see a legacy character like that continually getting the shit sandwich?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe predictable outcome will be ridge running back to Brooke despite HIS PROMISES and over a year marked by HIS continual pursuit of emotional infidelity. If every time life gets difficult the person you want to lean on is the other woman you love, that is emotional infidelity because you&#39;re not leaning on your spouse and at every turn Ridge was excepting Taylor&#39;s kindness and relying on her love and support. If he goes back to Brooke, then it looks horrible on her that she would except it, it looks horrible that apparently he was lying to Taylor the whole time and she didn&#39;t catch onto it, and it looks horrible for him because it suggests that he never really meant any of the promises that he made to either woman. We have seen the story over and over again and it&#39;s beyond played out and it&#39;s beyond tone deaf in terms of where we are in 2022 these are grandparents for god sakes, they&#39;re supposed to be wiser by now than they were when they were 20 somethings yet they&#39;re literally paint playing out the same triangle. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf Rich surprises me and goes through with the marriage, that is the far more interesting choice. In fact, for suspense they could even have Bridge say that he can&#39;t commit until he first speaks to Brooke, have him go over and tell her the truth or better yet make Thomas tell her the truth, I have Brooke question the stability of the marriage if he would just leave without even giving her a reason, and then have Ridge realize the role he has played in this. He could hand Thomas his head on a platter and be disgusted with his sonbut at the same time he holds him accountable, Rich could also show some self reflection by pointing out to Brooke that the reason why he believed she made the call was because on some level she really does dislike his children and they clearly don&#39;t like her, a position which is truly untenable for him as a man trying to balance his role within a marriage with his role as a father within a family unit, even if his children are now adults. He could say that he selfishly didn&#39;t want to break up the marriage back in the day when Taylor came back from the dead come even though he&#39;s always loved both women, and that he now sees that he never gave enough thought to the effect his choice would have on his children. He could say that for him, losing Taylor to death twice was so hard on him that he couldn&#39;t imagine going back to that relationship and losing her a third time, while at the same time he couldn&#39;t imagine hurting Brooke again so he took the path of least resistance without at least trying to see if he could bring some semblance of peace to the table between Brooke and his children and that that decision has left him a man torn in half all of these years and that ping-ponging back-and-forth between the two didn&#39;t set a great example for his son which is why his son is now such a mess. He could also suggest that it&#39;s only because his daughter has proven to be exceptional that she isn&#39;t equally damaged by his choice as it&#39;s clear that she has the same conflict with Brooke as his son. Rich could point out that while Thomas has broken his heart, the reality is that Brooke was on the verge of making that call Which is why Thomas was so affectively able to put his plan in motion. Ridge could say that he had to come because he owed Brooke betterbut he also agrees with her that this situation pointed to a weakness in the marriage that if they are both honest, they would have to admit is unresolvable. Through tears he could apologize to her saying that both she and Taylor both deserved a man who could give them his whole heart and he could swear to her that part of him will always love herbut that he is going to try to finally let her move on so that he can step up and focus on trying to heal his family. He doesn&#39;t have to even marry Taylor now, and in fact it would show real maturity if he instead went back to Taylor and said that he didn&#39;t want to marry her until she felt the kind of confidence in him that he has always felt in her love, saying that this has long been a problem in their marriage and he doesn&#39;t want it to be a factor in their future. He could point to their earlier years together and admit to her that because he never made a truly firm decision between her and Brooke that his divided heart always left Taylor feeling insecure and vulnerable in the marriage and if their marriage had any true weakness it was the fact that he never was able to give Taylor that comfort level and that he now wants to do better. He could tell that he also didn&#39;t wanna get married on a day that was so marred by ugliness and she also hadn&#39;t felt comfortable going forward with her before he had truly resolved his issues with Brooke. He could admit to Taylor that he ultimately hadn&#39;t treated Brooke very well and he knew he owed her at least that much. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCVS has a choice now to do the predictable or to do some thing different. It&#39;s time for the custody battle that has been just off in the Horisont ever since Thomas put pen to paper. Yes Ridge Hass to be justifiably disgusted with Thomas right nowbut fathers don&#39;t walk away from their sons or at least they shouldn&#39;t so instead of pushing him away, this could be the moment that Ridge steps up and pulls him closer, maybe even going into counseling with him. Since Brook would now have no incentive to play nice with Thomas And I hope is guaranteed to feel humiliated by the fact that she didn&#39;t see this coming at all, they could now insist on full custody and feel justified in pursuing it aggressively. Eric is with Donna and he also has that fondness for Brooke, so I think he&#39;s going to be pretty disgusted with Thomas and their four take a neutral to Logan leading position in any custody battle, while Ridge and Taylor would obviously be firmly behind Thomas. Brooke could go have a grand romance with Bill and Taylor and Ridge could finally have a Grande, location type wedding, we could get a month or two of bickering and then the trial could kick off. When that storyline concludes may be nine or even 12 months later, that would be the time you bring back RJ and the idea that again ridge is in this position where his child has been hurt by his indecisiveness and wants his father and mother back together even though Rich is now happily married to Taylor. In other words it&#39;s doing the predictable or continuing the triangle in a way that actually allows the characters to mature and be more thoughtful about the way they interact with one another."",

Taylor didn't put the lie i to motion or advance the lie over time (that was Thomas after watching brooke play with his father's heart for the better part of the year and after watching his father toy with his mothers heart for the better part of the year), Taylor never forced Ridge to get on a plane, Taylor never forced Brooke to repeatedly smear Thomas and to threaten the very call to Cps that he would later fake in an effort to prevent Thomas from reclaiming custody of his rightful son, and Taylor never pressured ridge to swear that he should have come back to Taylor sooner let alone to propose marriage, yeah it's pretty clear that they're setting her up to be the scapegoat for much of it and of course she'll pay the price. Krista Allen was a phenomenal find for the recast role and her chemistry with Thorsten Kaye is electric, particularly when compared to that between him and KKL, who has far more chemistry with Don diamont IMHO. If all they were ever going to write is the dysfunctional back-and-forth with Bridge why didn't they just let Bridge be dysfunctional and let Taylor move on the back when he fell for the phony \""I can't take care of myself because I have a bad ankle,\"" mealy-mouthed Brooke story They had playing out six months ago? Did they recast the role just to have a foil with which to prop up interest in the tired Bridge pairing? Who wants to see a legacy character like that continually getting the shit sandwich?\n\nThe predictable outcome will be ridge running back to Brooke despite HIS PROMISES and over a year marked by HIS continual pursuit of emotional infidelity. If every time life gets difficult the person you want to lean on is the other woman you love, that is emotional infidelity because you're not leaning on your spouse and at every turn Ridge was excepting Taylor's kindness and relying on her love and support. If he goes back to Brooke, then it looks horrible on her that she would except it, it looks horrible that apparently he was lying to Taylor the whole time and she didn't catch onto it, and it looks horrible for him because it suggests that he never really meant any of the promises that he made to either woman. We have seen the story over and over again and it's beyond played out and it's beyond tone deaf in terms of where we are in 2022 these are grandparents for god sakes, they're supposed to be wiser by now than they were when they were 20 somethings yet they're literally paint playing out the same triangle. \n\nIf Rich surprises me and goes through with the marriage, that is the far more interesting choice. In fact, for suspense they could even have Bridge say that he can't commit until he first speaks to Brooke, have him go over and tell her the truth or better yet make Thomas tell her the truth, I have Brooke question the stability of the marriage if he would just leave without even giving her a reason, and then have Ridge realize the role he has played in this. He could hand Thomas his head on a platter and be disgusted with his sonbut at the same time he holds him accountable, Rich could also show some self reflection by pointing out to Brooke that the reason why he believed she made the call was because on some level she really does dislike his children and they clearly don't like her, a position which is truly untenable for him as a man trying to balance his role within a marriage with his role as a father within a family unit, even if his children are now adults. He could say that he selfishly didn't want to break up the marriage back in the day when Taylor came back from the dead come even though he's always loved both women, and that he now sees that he never gave enough thought to the effect his choice would have on his children. He could say that for him, losing Taylor to death twice was so hard on him that he couldn't imagine going back to that relationship and losing her a third time, while at the same time he couldn't imagine hurting Brooke again so he took the path of least resistance without at least trying to see if he could bring some semblance of peace to the table between Brooke and his children and that that decision has left him a man torn in half all of these years and that ping-ponging back-and-forth between the two didn't set a great example for his son which is why his son is now such a mess. He could also suggest that it's only because his daughter has proven to be exceptional that she isn't equally damaged by his choice as it's clear that she has the same conflict with Brooke as his son. Rich could point out that while Thomas has broken his heart, the reality is that Brooke was on the verge of making that call Which is why Thomas was so affectively able to put his plan in motion. Ridge could say that he had to come because he owed Brooke betterbut he also agrees with her that this situation pointed to a weakness in the marriage that if they are both honest, they would have to admit is unresolvable. Through tears he could apologize to her saying that both she and Taylor both deserved a man who could give them his whole heart and he could swear to her that part of him will always love herbut that he is going to try to finally let her move on so that he can step up and focus on trying to heal his family. He doesn't have to even marry Taylor now, and in fact it would show real maturity if he instead went back to Taylor and said that he didn't want to marry her until she felt the kind of confidence in him that he has always felt in her love, saying that this has long been a problem in their marriage and he doesn't want it to be a factor in their future. He could point to their earlier years together and admit to her that because he never made a truly firm decision between her and Brooke that his divided heart always left Taylor feeling insecure and vulnerable in the marriage and if their marriage had any true weakness it was the fact that he never was able to give Taylor that comfort level and that he now wants to do better. He could tell that he also didn't wanna get married on a day that was so marred by ugliness and she also hadn't felt comfortable going forward with her before he had truly resolved his issues with Brooke. He could admit to Taylor that he ultimately hadn't treated Brooke very well and he knew he owed her at least that much. \n\nCVS has a choice now to do the predictable or to do some thing different. It's time for the custody battle that has been just off in the Horisont ever since Thomas put pen to paper. Yes Ridge Hass to be justifiably disgusted with Thomas right nowbut fathers don't walk away from their sons or at least they shouldn't so instead of pushing him away, this could be the moment that Ridge steps up and pulls him closer, maybe even going into counseling with him. Since Brook would now have no incentive to play nice with Thomas And I hope is guaranteed to feel humiliated by the fact that she didn't see this coming at all, they could now insist on full custody and feel justified in pursuing it aggressively. Eric is with Donna and he also has that fondness for Brooke, so I think he's going to be pretty disgusted with Thomas and their four take a neutral to Logan leading position in any custody battle, while Ridge and Taylor would obviously be firmly behind Thomas. Brooke could go have a grand romance with Bill and Taylor and Ridge could finally have a Grande, location type wedding, we could get a month or two of bickering and then the trial could kick off. When that storyline concludes may be nine or even 12 months later, that would be the time you bring back RJ and the idea that again ridge is in this position where his child has been hurt by his indecisiveness and wants his father and mother back together even though Rich is now happily married to Taylor. In other words it's doing the predictable or continuing the triangle in a way that actually allows the characters to mature and be more thoughtful about the way they interact with one another."",
