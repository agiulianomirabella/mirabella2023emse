McCartney has often conventional and “vertical” melodies, and Lennon has both vertical and “horizontal” melodies”.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe greatness of John Lennon´s music as i see it:\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e–His increasing tension. For example I Should Have Known Better. Before Lennon, all pop music structure was AABA, where the tension decreased in the middle part B. But with Lennon the tension from the verse continued in the middle part. Besides that, in this song it is not only a key change in the transition to the middle part, it is even a little key change in it. The increasing tension was what first characterized The Beatles. The first single where the verse lacked this increasing tension was the vers melody in Can´t Buy Me Love.\u003cbr\u003e – Other ways of increase the tension by Lennon is to pack together several little songs. Happiness Is A Warm Gun consists of three or four songs, and Bring On The Lucie consists of three songs.\u003cbr\u003e –All You Need Is Love has another way: First talking, then repeating half singing, then singing, and finally the climax in chorus. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e–The melody does not changesbut the chords in the background. For example in Strawberry Fields Forever and in Julia the singing melody uses the same notesbut instead the accompaniment changes! Listen to Puccini. He got tired of his sang melodies in Boheme and in Tosca he composed a lot where the sang melodies are often on the same notesbut the background changes instead. The effect can be stronger. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e–Octave Leap. For example, in the middle part of Please Please Me, Lennon makes an octave run in “…it´s so hard to reason with YOU…”, the climax of the song. George Martin didn´t understand the quality in that. In his orchestration of it in Off The Beatle Track, Martin excludes the octave, the most important bit of the song!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e –Verse and resolve. Typical for Lennon is a melody followed by a resolve, for example in No Reply “…I saw the light!”…and in Girl “giiirl! giiirl!…”. Lennon said that “a good song must have climax and resolve”. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e–Only one chord. In Tomorrow Never Knows there is only one chord, or bass note, an innovation in pop music. In the Middle Ages it was common with that bordun note, an unchanged bass note. When Lennon played the song the first time for George Martin, Martin didn´t like it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e–Whole-tone scale. Most scales have both whole step and half steps between the notes in an octave. In the verse in Norwegian Wood, there is most whole steps, and that´s like the impressionists, for example Debussy. It sounds very “clean”. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e–Church Modes. A Hard Day´s Night is written in the “mixolydian mode”, an ancient vocal scale, preserved in British, Irish and American folk song. –If you play the beginning of Please Please Me very fast, you can hear the similarities with the Westminster bells ringing. When Lennon was a little boy, he loved visiting the divine services. Afterwards he used to improvise anthem music. Westminster bells could unconsciously have inspired him to the beginning of Please Please Me. There is also anthem music in the beginning of All You Need Is Love: “love love love…”. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e–The lamentation second. A little half step up in the scale. And that´s to indicate a pain. In All You Need Is Love Lennon sings the refrain twice unchanged and then suddenly the third time, rises a little, a very expressive and important step up. That step up started in the baroque epoch, and was called The lamentation second. When Lennon played it the first time to George Martin, Martin didn´t understand it. He leaned towards McCartney and muttered: “It´s certainly repetitive”.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e–From darkness to light. Happiness Is a Warm Gun starts with a little melancholy, and ends with enthusiasm.—In the middle part of I Am The Walrus the darkness switches over to light: “sitting in an English garden…”. And the transition from the chaos and darkness in Revolution 9 to the light in Good Night. That is very typical in Wagner´s music. I think that temperamentally the two were similar. And I think Wagner would have loved the arrangement in Glass Onion. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e–Suggestive and hypnotic music. With small intervals between the notes in combination with some dissonance chord, Lennon can create a suggestive and hypnotic feeling in for example Across The Universe. It is more like Wagner than pop music.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e–Few notes. With fewbut effective notes, Lennon can create more feeling than McCartney with all his notes, for example in If I Fell and Love. –A melody sang three times, in succession, with just a little change every time. When you hear it you can get frustrated or desperate not getting out from the melody. That we have in the middle part in I Call Your Name and in the middle part in And Your Bird Can Sing. And at the same time the melodies are stick together with a countermelody at the guitar. Rather hypnotic \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e–Melodies without joint. An innovation.

              ""textOriginal"": ""@Brad Bell Moffat was a great showrunner who had a few misteps, probably due to the fact he'd been working on the show so long and was running out of fresh ideas. Moffat revitalised Doctor Who again, and gave it some meaningful structure that it so desperately needed. I really enjoy RTD's run but as an overall story, it pales in comparison to Moffat's ambitious (sometimes over ambitious to a point of issue) take on The Doctor and his universe."",
