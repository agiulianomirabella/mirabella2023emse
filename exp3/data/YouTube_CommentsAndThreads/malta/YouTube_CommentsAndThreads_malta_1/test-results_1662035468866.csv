Apparently theyre like caviar to sharks lol...a little delicacy. We got there(Anna Maria Island) real early one Am and I was just lying on my stomach watching the ocean and I thought I was hallucinating! This black tipped dorsal fin(hence the name Black tipped Shark) was just going back and forth getting closer to the beach with each turn. He had a system you could tell! He was like &#39;mowing the lawn&#39;. Down parallel to the shore turn, down the other direction, turn, and getting closer with each turn. He&#39;d only get just so close. Afraid of beaching himself I suppose? He would then go under and youd not see him again until he popped back up further out then he&#39;d start again. It was fascinating. It looked like there were maybe a hslf dozen but it was hard to tell. In the month of August the tiny jelly fish are born in the shallows. We took our boat out to a deserted little key and we left quite a bit later than usual one particular day. The sun was setting behind the island from where we were parked so we were in complete shade. BIG MISTAKE! Dusk it seems is magic hour for those lil stingin bastards! We started haulin our gear back out to where the boat was anchored. The tide was coming in fast and trying to get our stuff back onto the boat was a bitch! As we wade out to the boat we all start feeling these tiny little zaps! Oh holy shit then once we took a close look at the water there were THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS of those jellies. All diff sizes but most the size of your thumb nail. You couldnt even maneuver around em the water was so thick with them. Talk about something to see. My poor husband lol...he had to carry me then his daughter out to the boat on his shoulders. We were so freaked out we just plopped down in the sand and refused to budge til he came for us! He was haulin us thru the water goin &quot;ohh! Ouch! Little fuckers!....&quot; with every little zap. His vocabulary definitely covered the spectrum that day. Ill never forget that sight. Had you drug a styrofoam cup thru the water youd come away with a dozen at least no matter where you put the cup in. We noticed we were the last people that day to leave. It all became SO CLEAR as to why that was. This is a perfect example for researching your environment when camping."",
