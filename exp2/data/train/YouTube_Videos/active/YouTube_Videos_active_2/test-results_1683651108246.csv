        ""description"": ""Time dilation and Einstein’s theory of relativity go hand in hand. Albert Einstein is the most popular physicist, as he formulated the theory of relativity, which gave the Energy mass equivalence formula and is directly related to time dilation. But what is time dilation? Time dilation and space time are interrelated. Einstein made one of the most important contributions to physics and had the concept of space time explained. A simple explanation of space time is that it is a mathematical model that fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional continuum. But it is very important to understand that the general theory of relativity and the special theory of relativity are different. In this short animated video, we give a simple explanation of time dilation and Einstein’s theory of relativity and also explain how time slows down in a moving vehicle!\n\n\n#science #animation #timedilation #TheoryofRelativity \n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://faraday.physics.utoronto.ca/PVB/Harrison/GenRel/TimeDilation.html\nhttp://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/einsteinlight/jw/module4_time_dilation.htm\nhttps://web.pa.msu.edu/courses/2000fall/PHY232/lectures/relativity/dilation.html\nhttp://www.physics.nyu.edu/~ts2/Animation/Time_dilation.html\n\n\nOriginal Article Link: https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/universe/time-dilation-why-does-gravity-slow-down-the-flow-of-time.html\n\nIf you wish to buy/license this video, please write to us at admin@scienceabc.com.\n\nVoice Over Artist: John Staughton ( https://www.fiverr.com/jswildwood )\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com"",
