              ""textOriginal"": ""It is not accurate to say that Einstein \""made up some bullsh*t\"" because he couldn't disprove his idols' findings. In fact, Einstein's theories of relativity were based on rigorous mathematical and scientific reasoning, and have been extensively tested and verified through experiments.\r\n\r\nThe theories of relativity were developed in response to certain inconsistencies and paradoxes in classical physics, such as the Michelson-Morley experiment, which could not be explained by existing theories. Einstein's theories of relativity resolved these inconsistencies and provided a more accurate and comprehensive framework for understanding the behavior of matter and energy in the universe.\r\n\r\nIt is also not accurate to say that the explanations provided by Einstein do not make sense. While some of the concepts and terminology used in relativity may be difficult to grasp at first, they are based on sound scientific principles and have been demonstrated through numerous experiments and observations.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, while quantum mechanics and relativity are both highly successful theories in their respective domains, they are not incompatible or contradictory. In fact, efforts to reconcile these two theories have led to some of the most exciting and active areas of research in physics today.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is important to approach these topics with an open mind and a willingness to learn, rather than dismissing them as \""nonsensical jargon\""."",

That doesnt mean time has stopped for him, it just means he visually cant see whats happening at his point of origin because the light from that location cant catch up to him.

If he was looking at the point of origin he would see things as they happened 1 year ago, sort of looking at the past. But at the actual point of origin they would be 1 year ahead of what hes seeing through his telescope. This doesnt mean he has traveled forward in time…. It just means that he cannot view what is happening CURRENTLY at his point of origin. But he and the point of origin would still be existing on the same time plane. If he were to ever return to the point of origin, his watch would still say the same time as the clock tower.

So, if a person was falling down a hole through the center of the Earth there would constantly be more and more mass behind him/her and less mass towards the front.  At the center, gravity is equal in all directions (ignoring the effects of objects in space which is nearly unmeasurably small).  Imagine a person falling through such a hole.  They would pass through the center and toward the surface on the opposite side of the earth.  But because of air friction, they wouldn't make it all the way to the surface, instead falling back toward the center.  This yoyoing would continue until the person eventually settled to the center of the Earth where all the gravitational forces balance out.  The force of gravity points towards the centerbut is actually the strongest at the surface."",
