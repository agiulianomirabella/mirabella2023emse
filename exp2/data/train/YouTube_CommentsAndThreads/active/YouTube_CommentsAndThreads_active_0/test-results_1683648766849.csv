It discusses, for example, how time is experienced differently in the different ‘skies’ or ‘dimensions’ of the universe. It’s mentioned that there are 7 such ‘skies’ or ‘dimensions’ (in fact – we’re told the observable stars belong to only the first sky/dimension). For example, one verse translates roughly to: “He arranges [each] matter from the heaven to the earth; then it will ascend to Him in a Day, the extent of which is a thousand years of those which you count.” [32:5] I find it very interesting, especially given it was revealed about 1400 years ago :) If you’re interested in learning more don’t hesitate to ask."",
