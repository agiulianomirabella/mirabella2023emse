This is why insurance is not based on the certainty of outcomes but the uncertainty of a patient&#39;s health. In other words, insurance companies cannot reliably put a market value on non-elective treatment, especially for chronic treatment. This is also called inelastic demand.

Private companies will go as far as to get rid of pre-existing conditions and cut preventative and primary care for chronic patients because there is short term diminishing returns for such treatment. They do not make a profit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are flat out wrong. People do not buy insurance on the assumption of certainty with their health. They buy it for the uncertainty about their health and its inherently unstable nature. This is basic human psychology. They buy it before they need to use it so that they are not shopping around and have limited choices at the time of care. This is also why medicare and Medicaid exist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;If there was actually a competitive mechanism and power was restored to individauls, things like malpractice, profiteering and price gouging would be addressed like they are in any other industry.

Ideally, yes. We would get rid of for-profit insurance and have the cost of treatment be subsidized by a larger nationalized risk pool. The free market fails at pricing out non-elective care. This is simply a fact. They have short-term profits on their minds not the care of the patient. This literally happened in Taiwan and India.

Couple that with monetary and fiscal policy decisions that doesn&#39;t debase the currency, the money we make from our jobs would have more purchasing power than it does currently and empower us to buy the things we need to live happy lives, like health insurance. &quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrevention and Primary care are the best and cheapest solutions moving forward.

              ""textOriginal"": ""@Sui Juris \""You are presuming some type of self-imposed authority and assuming that there is no counter-argument to your claim. \""\n\n\nNo. I'm not the authority here. Basic economic principles are the authority here. You are the one trying to argue that 2+2 does not equal 4.  \n\n\n\""Put simply, the cosmetic model will not work for traditional non-elective care.\r This is any form of treatment that is NOT considered life-threatening or life-altering due to health degradation.\""\n\n\nSee what you are failing to recognize is that there is a massive portion of healthcare service expenditures that are not life-threatening and do not contribute to higher risk-assessment. You don't know your numbers. By contrast, in the early part of the 20th century, if you fractured or broke your arm you would simply go to the doctor and pay him directly with cash to put a cast on it. You didn't have to pay an insurance company for this common non-elective treament, and it was more affordable for regular people because you cut out having to pay the beurocracies of an insurane company and your employer for something that has almost no risk involved whatsoever (something like 80-90% of people suffer this injury at some point in their life).     \n\n\n\""More regulation for non-elective care is essential and protects consumers from, malpractice, profiteering, and price gouging. The private market is notoriously and historically bad at protecting high-risk pools or 'sick' people.\""\n\n\nThe only reason why the private market is 'notoriously and historically' bad at protecting high-risk pools is because we do not have a free market system and have not had one for generations. The entire concept of insurance is that people are supposed to have insurance BEFORE they become sick and become high risk. If there was actually a competitive mechanism and power was restored to individauls, things like malpractice, profiteering and price gouging would be addressed like they are in any other industry. You can not stay in business price gouging people if other companies are offering superior services at lower prices.
