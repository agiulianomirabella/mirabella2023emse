The 230 knife homicides in England and Wales year ending 2021are a tragedybut they don't even begin to compare with the people dying as a result of gun violence in the US.  I have only had one incident of crime in my life, with someone smashing a window in an attempted robbery, nothing was taken and I'm not young.  I have never known anyone who has been stabbed, or ever had a friend who has been a victim of violent crime.  Gun crime  in Britain is extremely low, gun laws are very strict.  I feel that you would probably be safer in Britain, Europe, Australia Canada or New Zealand.  I don't see why people have to have AR15s either. Probably strict medical background checks, in America  would help as well. The age that people could purchase a gun, could be raised too.
