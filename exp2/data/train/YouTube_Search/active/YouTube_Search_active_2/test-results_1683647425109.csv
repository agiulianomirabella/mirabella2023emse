People thought it was too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn’t satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.\n\nHe imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer’s perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the groundbut since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. \n\nIn a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. \n\nEinstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference\n\nHe imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. \n\nHowever, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can’t be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. \n\nThis was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.\n\nIt’s important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes onlybut it is really in 3D.  \n\nIn order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury’s orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. \n\nBut many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. \n#generalrelativity\n#einstein\nWhy is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. \n\nGeneral relativity does not answer everything. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn’t really tell us what exactly it is."",

        ""title"": ""Special Relativity simplified using no math. Einstein thought experiments"",
        ""description"": ""Einstein's Special Relativity Explained Simply - no math\n\nThis entire revolution in physics started with a simple thought experiments, in the prolific imagination before Einstein even graduated from high school.  Einstein’s theory of special relativity is convention today. But to understand how revolutionary it was for its time, it is helpful to look at what the conventional understanding of physics was during the time of Einstein’s teenage years.\n\nIn 1801, Thomas Young had conducted a simple double slit experiment that showed that light behaved like a wave. So the  theory about light at the time was that it was a wave.  The problem is that a wave, it was thought, had to move through some sort of medium. They called this substance the luminiferous aether.  \n\nBut in 1887, two scientists by the name of Albert Michelson and Edward Morely came up with an idea to test the existence of the aether. The background ether was believed to be unmoving and static, so if the wave was traveling in the same direction as the earth, the speed of the wave should be higher in the direction of the speed of the earth. Michelson and Morley showed that there was no difference in the speed of light of the two measurements. This seriously jeopardized the aether theory.  \n\nEinstein knew this, so he came up with a thought experiment as a 16 year old.  His thought was to imagine that he was chasing a beam of light while traveling at the speed of light himself.  What would he see? If young Albert could catch up to the beam, he should see a stationary wave.\n\nYet that was impossible. Einstein knew such stationary fields would violate the equations of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk Maxwell 20 years earlier. \n\nSo he came up with two postulates, and tried to figure out what the physics would be if the two postulates were true.\nPostulate 1 was that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial reference frames. \nPostulate 2 was that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all inertial reference frames.  \n\nThe first postulate had been assumed for hundreds of years. The second postulate, however, was the revolution. \n\nThis meant that young Einstein would never see the stationary, oscillating fields, because he could never catch the light beam.\nBut this solution seemed to have fatal flaw. Einstein later explained the problem with another thought experiment: \n\nImagine firing a light beam along a railroad embankment just as a train roars by in the same direction at, say, 2,000 miles a second. Someone standing on the embankment would measure the light beam’s speed to be the standard number, 186,000 miles a second. But someone on the train would see it moving past at only 184,000 miles a second. \n\nIf the speed of light was not constant, Maxwell’s equations would somehow have to look different inside the railcar, and the first postulate would be violated. The solution to his thought experiment was that observers in relative motion experience time differently. This completely overturned hundreds of years of classical physics in which time was absolute in the universe.  Einstein showed that time is relative, and varies in different frames of reference. The idea of the aether was no longer needed. \n   \nThis one realization that reality is not the same for different frames of reference also led to other implications of special relativity:\nThat Fast moving object appear shorter\nThat Fast moving objects appears to have increased mass \nAnd finally, the most famous equation in science E=MC2\nThat mass and energy are equivalent.\n\nSo, how did Einstein come up with his most famous equation based on his original two postulates? Let’s look at this conceptually.  \n\nIf conservation of mass is interpreted as conservation of rest mass, this did not hold true in special relativity. Since different observers would disagree about what the energy of a system was, the mass and energy taken together must be conserved, not just the mass on its own. \n\nIt turns out that for the laws of physics, namely conservation of energy and momentum, to be consistent in the two \""reference frames\"" of two observers moving with respect to each other, there has to be an energy associated with a body at rest, not just a body in motion. And that is what E=MC2 implies – the M in the equation is the mass at rest.  \n\nSome people point out that much of the actual work for special relativity had already been done by the time Einstein presented it. The concepts of time dilation for moving objects, were already in place and the mathematics had already been developed by Lorentz & Poincare. Einstein still deserves the accolades because he rejected the idea of the ether all together which other scientists had not done, and the idea of mass and energy equivalence via E=MC2 is solely Einstein. Scientists who had done prior work like Thomson, Larmor, Lorentz, or Poincare had never implied such a bold proposition. \n\n#specialrelativity\n#einstein\n#michelsonmorley"",
