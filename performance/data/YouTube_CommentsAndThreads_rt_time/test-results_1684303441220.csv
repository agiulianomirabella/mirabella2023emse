However, as the moving eye approaches the speed of light, the fixed eye would observe the moving eye's clock to be ticking slower than its own clock due to the effects of time dilation. This means that time would appear to be passing more slowly for the moving eye.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of the moving eye, it would observe the world around it to be distorted due to the effects of special relativity. As the moving eye approaches the speed of light, objects in front of it would appear to be compressed in the direction of motion (length contraction). Additionally, time would appear to be passing normally for the moving eye, but the fixed eye's clock would appear to be ticking faster than its own clock due to the effects of time dilation.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that these effects are relative, and both observers would see the other's clock ticking slower or faster depending on their own perspective. Additionally, the scenario described is purely hypothetical and violates the laws of physics, so it's not possible to observe these effects in reality."",

Because Einstein copied the Lorentz derivation verbatim and called it time dilation, SRT is also invalid for time dilation unless two reference frames are going the same velocity and direction."",
              ""textOriginal"": ""@AMC2283 Just saying that if you look at either the Lorentz derivation that Einstein plagiarized from Lorentz or Einstein's time dilation derivation, which are one and the same, the derivations are invalid for mass increase, time dilation, or Lorentz contraction.\n\n\n Lorentz made substitutions which imply that his derivation is only valid when two reference frames are going the same velocity and direction.   Because Einstein copied the Lorentz derivation verbatim and called it time dilation, SRT is also invalid for time dilation unless two reference frames are going the same velocity and direction."",
