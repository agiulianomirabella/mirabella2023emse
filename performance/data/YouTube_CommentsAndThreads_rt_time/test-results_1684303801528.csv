            ""textDisplay"": ""Let me simplify it so everyone can understand.   Einstein was a charlatan who could get away with ridiculous and self contradictory claims.  Einstein claims time is dependent upon velocity.  Velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time, thus velocity is directly dependent upon time.  So if velocity dependent on time and time is dependent on velocity, you have a never ending circular fallacy.  Einstein could also divide by zero and get infinity.  Any other human would get a mathematically undefined answer.  Infinity is a concept; not a quantity.  Furthermore, Einstein is considered a scientist even though he did not use the scientific method.  Nor did he discover the photoelectric effect; he only provided an erroneous explanation of the photoelectric effect.  Einstein&#39;s genius was his ability to pull off bullshit and get away with it."",
