No single protest should cause more pain and suffering then thousands of other protests. Jan 06 cost 9 lives, if what you said about the extra two suicides is correct. 9,000 BLM protests only cost 9 lives. 1 Jan 06 protest was 100% violent. 93% of BLM protests were 0% violent. 7% were violent but many only became violent because of right wing radical attacks and police brutality. Jan 06 caused 140 police injured. All BLM protests only caused 700 police injuries meaning 1 single protest would have caused less then 0.08 police injuries. Is that better then? Bringing BLM down to the Jan 06 state. Though I did do that in my other calculations as well. It isn’t about predicting the future. It is about looking at things critically and seeing how bad one is over the other. There can very easily be more Jan 06’s if these right wing radicals don’t get their way.

They are still gathering the proof of what these corrupt politicians did so they can hold them accountable. They are still looking for some of the insurrectionists. Evidence is still being found and witnesses are still coming forward. Don’t focus on stuff that is over and done with. Focus on what is happening in the here and now.

Power to further their greed, vanity, and corruption; power to create a theocratic state; power to maintain paternalistic white supremacy; and power to please their plutocratic masters.   Which puts Democrats at a distinct disadvantage, because Republicans are willing to destroy our government and nation to get what they want, while Democrats seek to build and improve our government and nation.    \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Obama put it, &quot;They take the low road, we take the high road.&quot;  Or, as I put it here earlier, destroying democracy in order to save it is a fool&#39;s errand.  Also earlier here, I had compared the current political landscape to a minefield, which Democrats are forced to carefully negotiate.  It won&#39;t do for Democrats to adopt the sleazy tactics of Republicans, and that is not something Democratic voters would tolerate, anyway.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNonetheless, I don&#39;t know that it is fair to say that the fascist Republican cult is &quot;winning.&quot;  In fact, they are degrading and damaging the very prize they seek to win, which means that in the end everyone loses, including them.  The Republican party was already in the minority, and they are a shrinking minority.  Which explains in part the desperation evident.  I would say that if Manchin, Sinema, and Garland don&#39;t start stepping up to the plate, we could be in for some dark days ahead.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I also believe that the majority of Americans will always reject the dystopian, Orwellian fascist Republican world.  Any success Republicans have is likely to be only temporary and fleeting.  This fascist phase in American politics is likely to end sooner than later, just as happened with the original America First fascist movement of the 1920&#39;s and 30&#39;s.  There is hope.  But there is also plenty of work ahead for us to do.  Democracy requires constant vigilance and due diligence, and it is critical that we not allow ourselves to become complacent."",

Power to further their greed, vanity, and corruption; power to create a theocratic state; power to maintain paternalistic white supremacy; and power to please their plutocratic masters.   Which puts Democrats at a distinct disadvantage, because Republicans are willing to destroy our government and nation to get what they want, while Democrats seek to build and improve our government and nation.    \n\nAs Obama put it, \""They take the low road, we take the high road.\""  Or, as I put it here earlier, destroying democracy in order to save it is a fool's errand.  Also earlier here, I had compared the current political landscape to a minefield, which Democrats are forced to carefully negotiate.  It won't do for Democrats to adopt the sleazy tactics of Republicans, and that is not something Democratic voters would tolerate, anyway.  \n\nNonetheless, I don't know that it is fair to say that the fascist Republican cult is \""winning.\""  In fact, they are degrading and damaging the very prize they seek to win, which means that in the end everyone loses, including them.  The Republican party was already in the minority, and they are a shrinking minority.  Which explains in part the desperation evident.  I would say that if Manchin, Sinema, and Garland don't start stepping up to the plate, we could be in for some dark days ahead.  \n\nBut I also believe that the majority of Americans will always reject the dystopian, Orwellian fascist Republican world.  Any success Republicans have is likely to be only temporary and fleeting.  This fascist phase in American politics is likely to end sooner than later, just as happened with the original America First fascist movement of the 1920's and 30's.  There is hope.  But there is also plenty of work ahead for us to do.  Democracy requires constant vigilance and due diligence, and it is critical that we not allow ourselves to become complacent."",

So, we ended up getting a lot of old fool, that doesn&#39;t know shit that fancy themself to be Yoda on topic they know nothing about and we especially see this BS, on the political arena and political leadership, this is an issue going on in at least 50% of the countries right now, because, most baby boomers world wide are like this, not just the west. The end result you get a lot of self absorb, over confident and arrogant people running the country. As Dr. Phil and Confucius both said, people of such sort underestimate difficulty of situation and over estimate their capability and frequently refuse to listen to expert advice, result in them screwing up and instead, blame everybody for their mistake, because they think, they can&#39;t possibly be wrong, due to their arrogant, over confident and self absorb nature.

I once remember back in college, we were talking to this old lady our grandparent&#39;s generation that fought in WW2, she told the old lady &quot;i remember before I grew up I was like...&quot; and then the old lady laughed and said &quot;I am 78 years old and I am still growing up.&quot; What that mean is when they don&#39;t know something, they will through education and training to improve their skills, when they are not able to achieve that level of wisdom through life experience. I remember my grandma, by the age of 60, was learn English. Back in her days, English wasn&#39;t yet, the international language, this was very much something that gradually emerged, after WW2, due to the formation of the UN with the United States as its leader and the cold war. My grandma always use to say &quot;You should never stop learning new skills that become relevant&quot; As a result, you see our grandparent&#39;s generation is insanely wise, not only through the wisdom that come with age, but keep on learning their entire life, yet, I never hear anybody from our grandparent&#39;s generation yelling &quot;I ain&#39;t 40 years old for shit!&quot; &quot;I ain&#39;t 50 years old for shit!&quot; &quot;I ain&#39;t 60 years old for shit!&quot; despite that is a generation so wise, they got every right to yell &quot;I ain&#39;t 40, 50, 60 years old for  shit!&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCompare to our grandparent&#39;s generation. our parent&#39;s generation in their 40s, 50s and 60s are not even half as wise, compare to our grandparent&#39;s generation. And without doubt by the time they reach their 70s, they are not going to be half as wise, as our grand parent&#39;s generation in their 70s. Despite the fact, most people our grandparent&#39;s generation are only high school graduates, while our parent&#39;s generation are mostly college graduate. Grandma Hedy Lamarr for example, Grandma Lamarr&#39;s invention made possible modern flat screen technology and wifi technology, but she was only a high school graduated, in fact she was an actress! She was kinda like the Kiera Knightly equivalent for her days. Yet, she had such high level of knowledge in engineering, all through self taught. (I know grandma Lamarr is dead now, but I think we should still title her a honorary PhD) Our parent&#39;s generation on the other hand, their capability is more limit due to they are always screaming &quot;I ain&#39;t 40, 50, 60 years old for shit!&quot; mean, unlike our grandparent&#39;s generation they won&#39;t through education and training expend their knowledge, thus, after college, they are limited to what they can accomplish through experience and if they are one of those idiots that doesn&#39;t have the level of wisdom somebody their age should have, that just made it worse. And when they come across stuff they know nothing about, instead of researching for answer like what our grandparent&#39;s generation did, thus, continue to expand their knowledge base, our parent&#39;s generation just scream &quot;I ain&#39;t 40, 50, 60 years old for shit!&quot; and just theorist an answer and firmly believe their theory can&#39;t possibly be wrong, only problem is 9/10 time, their theory is 110% wrong, because they are working on topic they know nothing about. And, what make it worse is, they take their baseless theory as fact, due to thinking they can&#39;t possibly be wrong with their argument of &quot;I ain&#39;t 40, 50, 60 years old for shit!&quot; and further more. I mean nobody can possibly achieve the ultimate wisdom with the complete knowledge of everything and to be 100% wise in all arena, regardless how old and wise you are, yet our parent&#39;s generation believe they achieved that level of wisdom with their argument of  &quot;I ain&#39;t 40, 50, 60 years old for shit!&quot; \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e So, the end result is how our parent&#39;s generation is screwing up big time right now. We saw most significant in George Bush&#39;s administration where he sideline all middle Eastern experts, when dealing with iraq and Afghanistan issues, a region till date we still know very little about. We saw similar shit in the Gillard and Abbot government in Australia. A lot of other country saw similar shit, within baby boomer generation leaders. As a result, our parent&#39;s generation got very limited competent people. I mean Scott Morris and Melcomb Turnbull, might not be great, but at least they are not that same arrogant type that screw things up as a result, thus, at least with them in charge things aren&#39;t getting worse. In the US, basically we see our grandparent&#39;s generation return to politics, I mean say what you want about Donald Trump at least he get the job done (of course, Obama was not bad also, not everybody born in th 50s and 60 are arrogant old fools) in other countries we are seen baby boomer short live, in Taiwan for example, Gen Y now hold 1/3 of parliament when university students throughout the country form the new age reformation party in the 2010, for the first time, the parliament had hold by people age between 21~25 holding 1/3 of the seat, 9 years later they are now age 30~35. New Zealand, went even further basically threw baby boomer out of ministry position all together and got Gen Y running the country."",
