When they are Q questioning they still can be fired. Or she can&#39;t be fired cause she is lesbian and she actually bi sexual. She get to be fired or he gets to be fired, cause they we have threesomes\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethat is one re t A r &quot;dead&quot; situation that happened to him\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ealso how they have 3 kids was it IVF?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003esome man gravitate to women cause they probably thinking they slide their penis somewhere and there is no poo in there no trouble for them and that summarizes why they prefer to marry women and some of them with OCD do not mind washing so much so they do it with wife maybe maybe not but some of them say they do not and they do and they lie. cause who is gong to ask the wife. but this Saska and Monica were clearly upset Shawn stayed with me. So he was lying to them he did not and stayed with me secretly but it is a horrible situation even being wife is difficult basically I cant lie about this or cant be quiet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebut also i do not say all the time is is heterosexual JoUK because it is not is is all inclusive jo UK and we all questioning cheating but right now what happens in courts is absolutely surface level conversations about cheating when supposedly that is what marriage is about. I did not move to US thinking there is polygamy in here. I thought it was very conservative and respectful situation with marriage. But not only this it is favorite think for lawyers in order to have a job to tell people to not talk to each other even two smart grown up man like Donald True and Rodger Stone they only should not talk if they actually are married to women and they engage in homosexual relation so there is a way to prevent this from happening uncontrollably when they are left alone. And even they they might consider to be honest divorce their wives and get married to each other. In all other situations is seem an atrocity to to tell people to not talk to each other especially that Rodger was a friend and helped Donald Trump to be elated and make sensible laws.¬†\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough if Rodger was around I would tend to think that it is Rodger that is running the country and not Donal True but maybe he could just help president to at least not be attacked so much and clean up some corruption. Corrupted elements know that very well they cant full Rodger Stone and that is why they try to keep him away from talking to president Trump because Rodger is also no horse shit type of guy even that one time he was hanging out naked on the street. Was Rodger participating in any pedophilia parties and some of the people participating together with their wives.¬†\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mean that information cant be sealed really we need to know about pedophilia and not in a way that one actors told it and got a role in leading movies and he groped girls less that 10 years old.¬†\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what is going on , but after 12 and repeated groping with kids coming back for more after 11 literally and they get paid and hide from parents not because they are threatened but some of them maybe in love also and then no one can fill the shoes for them and they get depressed after they imagine themselves wife of top society when they are 14. But that isnt pedophilia. Is called heartbreak disappointment and bad parenting and that also we fail as society to prevent this situation not manage them by throwing man to jail and not make parents and kids themselves more responsible. No they seem to only benefits with orgasms and some cash money an dit is very interesting and attractive¬† if they actually are not in real need of money, which none of the girls that epsteins were interested were poverty stricken. They went to very good school and were top society. Basically these are spoiled girls that eve if their mothers knew they probably though give girl a chance seem to be a fairy tale businessmen.

When they are Q questioning they still can be fired. Or she can't be fired cause she is lesbian and she actually bi sexual. She get to be fired or he gets to be fired, cause they we have threesomes\n\nthat is one re t A r \""dead\"" situation that happened to him\n\nalso how they have 3 kids was it IVF?\n\nsome man gravitate to women cause they probably thinking they slide their penis somewhere and there is no poo in there no trouble for them and that summarizes why they prefer to marry women and some of them with OCD do not mind washing so much so they do it with wife maybe maybe not but some of them say they do not and they do and they lie. cause who is gong to ask the wife. but this Saska and Monica were clearly upset Shawn stayed with me. So he was lying to them he did not and stayed with me secretly but it is a horrible situation even being wife is difficult basically I cant lie about this or cant be quiet.\n\nbut also i do not say all the time is is heterosexual JoUK because it is not is is all inclusive jo UK and we all questioning cheating but right now what happens in courts is absolutely surface level conversations about cheating when supposedly that is what marriage is about. I did not move to US thinking there is polygamy in here. I thought it was very conservative and respectful situation with marriage. But not only this it is favorite think for lawyers in order to have a job to tell people to not talk to each other even two smart grown up man like Donald True and Rodger Stone they only should not talk if they actually are married to women and they engage in homosexual relation so there is a way to prevent this from happening uncontrollably when they are left alone. And even they they might consider to be honest divorce their wives and get married to each other. In all other situations is seem an atrocity to to tell people to not talk to each other especially that Rodger was a friend and helped Donald Trump to be elated and make sensible laws.¬†\n\nAlthough if Rodger was around I would tend to think that it is Rodger that is running the country and not Donal True but maybe he could just help president to at least not be attacked so much and clean up some corruption. Corrupted elements know that very well they cant full Rodger Stone and that is why they try to keep him away from talking to president Trump because Rodger is also no horse shit type of guy even that one time he was hanging out naked on the street. Was Rodger participating in any pedophilia parties and some of the people participating together with their wives.¬†\n\nI mean that information cant be sealed really we need to know about pedophilia and not in a way that one actors told it and got a role in leading movies and he groped girls less that 10 years old.¬†\n\nSo what is going on , but after 12 and repeated groping with kids coming back for more after 11 literally and they get paid and hide from parents not because they are threatened but some of them maybe in love also and then no one can fill the shoes for them and they get depressed after they imagine themselves wife of top society when they are 14. But that isnt pedophilia. Is called heartbreak disappointment and bad parenting and that also we fail as society to prevent this situation not manage them by throwing man to jail and not make parents and kids themselves more responsible. No they seem to only benefits with orgasms and some cash money an dit is very interesting and attractive¬† if they actually are not in real need of money, which none of the girls that epsteins were interested were poverty stricken. They went to very good school and were top society. Basically these are spoiled girls that eve if their mothers knew they probably though give girl a chance seem to be a fairy tale businessmen.

Because I¬† recommend for politicians to not be involved into similar situations.¬†\n\nTo tel Judge decide this no matter what so what does it even make a DD J A d g e¬† r o UL?\n\nAlso when people are upset they cant be told that it is better for you to not put you through sessions with a social worker or psychologist with special education because someone how it reflects badly on the record cause we have psychologist social workers that generate stigma with judges. The only stigma I have currently is with psychiatrist since they prescribe horrible medication they do not even believe in.¬†\n\nThere is no autism there are bad parents who either benefit from the idea their kids being diagnosed or trying to justify their existence by saying they looking after sick kid. Or it is a diet and horrible situations such as parents cheating or poverty or overly controlling that make kids distracted and pretend they ignore something. Plus many parents thing that being autistic makes their kid genus in some ways the word special basically they do anything be is transvestite or autstic they seem to want to label everything. There is always individual situation. It could be a pattern or one time corrective action.¬†\n\nInheritance taxes and rules need to figure it out. Lot of people trying to control their kids through holding the price in front of them thinking that buys them security. Or maybe it is kids who are being control by thinking if they behave they get a pie of something if the kids cant be trusted maybe that is appropriate strategy but that is Maceavelian.\n\nIt seem trust exist in situation actually when people cant be trusted and sometime strust exist to mask and not disclose certain people name involved .\n\nI also did ot just apologized but I hopefully explained that what ombudsman office did that upset me. If the decisions was made for them then I do not have to write mailing list here, who do i email?\n\nAlso is that the reason that bank wants to know how to log into people personal email addresses so they delete the email they regret they sent instead of explaining what prompted change of mind or why they want to hide they said or send that email.¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nInna Barrett"",
