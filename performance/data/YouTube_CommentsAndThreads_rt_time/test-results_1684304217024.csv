At the center, gravity is equal in all directions (ignoring the effects of objects in space which is nearly unmeasurably small).  Imagine a person falling through such a hole.  They would pass through the center and toward the surface on the opposite side of the earth.  But because of air friction, they wouldn&#39;t make it all the way to the surface, instead falling back toward the center.  This yoyoing would continue until the person eventually settled to the center of the Earth where all the gravitational forces balance out.

The faster an object moves, the slower time appears to pass for it relative to a stationary observer. This effect has been demonstrated in a number of experiments, such as the Hafele-Keating experiment, which used atomic clocks to measure the effects of time dilation on airplanes flying in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nIt's important to keep an open mind when considering scientific concepts, and to be willing to consider evidence that contradicts one's preconceived notions. While it's understandable to be skeptical of new or unfamiliar ideas, it's important to engage with them in a respectful and constructive manner, rather than dismissing them outright."",
