The shock was centered in The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park approximately 10 mi (16 km) northeast of Santa Cruz on a section of the San Andreas Fault System and was named for the nearby Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains. With an Mw magnitude of 6.9[10] and a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent), the shock was responsible for 63 deaths and 3,757 injuries. The Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas Fault System had been relatively inactive since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (to the degree that it was designated a seismic gap) until two moderate foreshocks occurred in June 1988 and again in August 1989.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDamage was heavy in Santa Cruz County and less so to the south in Monterey Countybut effects extended well to the north into the San Francisco Bay Area, both on the San Francisco Peninsula and across the bay in Oakland.

Total displacement for these shocks was relatively small (approximately 4 in (100 mm) of strike-slip and substantially less reverse-slip) and although they occurred on separate faults and well before the mainshock, a group of seismologists considered these to be foreshocks due to their location in space and time relative to the main event. Each event&#39;s aftershock sequence and effect on stress drop was closely examined, and their study indicated that the shocks affected the mainshock&#39;s rupture process. Following the August 8, 1989, shock, in anticipation of an upcoming large earthquake, staff at the University of California, Santa Cruz deployed four accelerometers in the area, which were positioned at the UCSC campus, two residences in Santa Cruz, and a home in Los Gatos. Unlike other nearby (high gain) seismographs that were overwhelmed (driven off scale) by the large magnitude mainshock, the four accelerometers captured a useful record of the main event and more than half an hour of the early aftershock activity.[8][13]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe June 27, 1988, shock occurred with a maximum intensity of VI (Strong).

More moderate damage resulted from the August 8, 1989, shock (intensity VII, Very strong) when chimneys were toppled in Cupertino, Los Gatos, and Redwood Estates. Other damage included cracked walls and foundations and broken underground pipes. At the office of the Los Gatos City Manager, a window that was cracked had also been broken in the earlier shock.

Fraser-Smith of Stanford University reported that the event was preceded by disturbances in background magnetic field noise as measured by a sensor placed in Corralitos, about 4.5 miles (7 km) from the epicenter.[27] From October 5, they reported that a substantial increase in noise was measured in the frequency range 0.01–10 Hz.[27] The measurement instrument was a single-axis search-coil magnetometer that was being used for low frequency research.[27] Precursor increases of noise apparently started a few days before the earthquake, with noise in the range 0.01–0.5 Hz rising to exceptionally high levels about three hours before the earthquake.[27] The Fraser-Smith et al. report remains one of the most frequently cited claims of a specific earthquake precursor, more recent studies have cast doubt on the connection, attributing the Corralitos signals to either unrelated magnetic disturbance or,[28] even more simply, to sensor-system malfunction.[29]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake#/media/File:LomaPrieta-Marina.jpeg\""\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake#/media/File:LomaPrieta-Marina.jpeg\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebuckled garage support"",

Fraser-Smith of Stanford University reported that the event was preceded by disturbances in background magnetic field noise as measured by a sensor placed in Corralitos, about 4.5 miles (7 km) from the epicenter.[27] From October 5, they reported that a substantial increase in noise was measured in the frequency range 0.01–10 Hz.[27] The measurement instrument was a single-axis search-coil magnetometer that was being used for low frequency research.[27] Precursor increases of noise apparently started a few days before the earthquake, with noise in the range 0.01–0.5 Hz rising to exceptionally high levels about three hours before the earthquake.[27] The Fraser-Smith et al. report remains one of the most frequently cited claims of a specific earthquake precursor, more recent studies have cast doubt on the connection, attributing the Corralitos signals to either unrelated magnetic disturbance or,[28] even more simply, to sensor-system malfunction.[29]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake#/media/File:LomaPrieta-Marina.jpeg\n\nbuckled garage support"",

              ""textDisplay"": ""The Mercury News response\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSurprised by The Washington Post article, The Mercury News executive editor Jerry Ceppos wrote to the Post defending the series.[36] The Post ultimately refused to print his letter.[37] Ceppos also asked reporter Pete Carey to write a critique of the series for publication in The Mercury News, and had the controversial website artwork changed.[36] Carey&#39;s critique appeared in mid-October and went through several of the Post criticisms of the series, including the importance of Blandón&#39;s drug ring in spreading crack, questions about Blandón&#39;s testimony in court, and how specific series allegations about CIA involvement had been, giving Webb&#39;s responses.[38]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the Los Angeles Times series appeared, Ceppos again wrote to defend the original series. He also defended the series in interviews with all three papers.[39] The extent of the criticism, however, convinced Ceppos that The Mercury News had to acknowledge to its readers that the series had been subjected to strong criticism.[40] He did this in a column that appeared on November 3, defending the seriesbut also committing the paper to a review of major criticisms.[41]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCeppos&#39; column drew editorial responses from both The New York Times and The Washington Post. An editorial in the Times, while criticizing the series for making &quot;unsubstantiated charges,&quot; conceded that it did find &quot;drug-smuggling and dealing by Nicaraguans with at least tentative connections to the Contras&quot; and called for further investigation.[42]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Post response came from the paper&#39;s ombudsman, Geneva Overholser.[43] Overholser was harshly critical of the series, &quot;reported by a seemingly hotheaded fellow willing to have people leap to conclusions his reporting couldn&#39;t back up.&quot; But while calling the flaws in the series &quot;unforgivably careless journalism,&quot; Overholser also criticized the Post&#39;s refusal to print Ceppos&#39; letter defending the series and sharply criticized the Post&#39;s coverage of the story. Calling the Post&#39;s overall focus &quot;misplaced&quot;, Overholser expressed regret that the paper had not taken the opportunity to re-examine whether the CIA had overlooked Contra involvement in drug smuggling, &quot;a subject The Post and the public had given short shrift.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn contrast, the series received support from Steve Weinberg, a former executive director of Investigative Reporters and Editors. In a long review of the series&#39; claims in The Baltimore Sun, Weinberg said: &quot;I think the critics have been far too harsh. Despite some hyped phrasing, &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; appears to be praiseworthy investigative reporting.&quot;[44]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the series&#39; publication, the Northern California branch of the national Society of Professional Journalists had voted Webb &quot;Journalist of the Year&quot; for 1996.[45] Despite the controversy that soon overtook the series, and the request of one board member to reconsider, the branch&#39;s board went ahead with the award in November.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnd of the series\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter Ceppos&#39; column, The Mercury News spent the next several months conducting an internal review of the story. The review was conducted primarily by editor Jonathan Krim and reporter Pete Carey, who had written the paper&#39;s first published analysis of the series. Carey ultimately decided that there were problems with several parts of the story and wrote a draft article incorporating his findings.[46]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe paper also gave Webb permission to visit Central America again to get more evidence supporting the story.[47] By January, Webb filed drafts of four more articles based on his tripbut his editors concluded that the new articles would not help shore up the original series&#39; claims.[48]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe editors met with Webb several times in February to discuss the results of the paper&#39;s internal review and eventually decided to print neither Carey&#39;s draft article nor the articles Webb had filed.[49] Webb was allowed to keep working on the story and made one more trip to Nicaragua in March. At the end of March, however, Ceppos told Webb that he was going to present the internal review findings in a column.[48] After discussions with Webb, the column was published on May 11, 1997.[50]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the column, Ceppos continued to defend parts of the article, writing that the series had &quot;solidly documented&quot; that the drug ring described in the series did have connections with the Contras and did sell large quantities of cocaine in inner-city Los Angeles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, Ceppos wrote, the series &quot;did not meet our standards&quot; in four areas. 1) It presented only one interpretation of conflicting evidence and in one case &quot;did not include information that contradicted a central assertion of the series.&quot; 2) The series&#39; estimates of the money involved was presented as fact instead of an estimate. 3) The series oversimplified how the crack epidemic grew. 4) The series &quot;created impressions that were open to misinterpretation&quot; through &quot;imprecise language and graphics.&quot;[51]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCeppos noted that Webb did not agree with these conclusions. He concluded, &quot;How did these shortcomings occur? ... I believe that we fell short at every step of our process: in the writing, editing and production of our work. Several people here share that burden ... But ultimately, the responsibility was, and is, mine.&quot;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eResignation\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebb strongly disagreed with Ceppos&#39;s column and in interviews, was harshly critical of the paper&#39;s handling of the story.[52] Editors at the paper, on the other hand, felt that Webb had failed to tell them about information that contradicted the series&#39; claims and that he &quot;responded to concerns not with reasoned argumentbut with accusations of us selling him out.&quot;[53] In June 1997, The Mercury News told Webb it was transferring him from the paper&#39;s Sacramento bureau and offered him a choice between working at the main offices in San Jose under closer editorial supervision, or spot reporting in Cupertino; both locations were long commutes from his home in Sacramento.[53] Webb eventually chose Cupertinobut was unhappy with the routine stories he was reporting there and the long commute.[54] He resigned from the paper in November 1997.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFederal investigation results\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reports of the three federal investigations into the claims of &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; were not released until over a year after the series&#39; publication.

              ""textOriginal"": ""The Mercury News response\n\nSurprised by The Washington Post article, The Mercury News executive editor Jerry Ceppos wrote to the Post defending the series.[36] The Post ultimately refused to print his letter.[37] Ceppos also asked reporter Pete Carey to write a critique of the series for publication in The Mercury News, and had the controversial website artwork changed.[36] Carey's critique appeared in mid-October and went through several of the Post criticisms of the series, including the importance of Blandón's drug ring in spreading crack, questions about Blandón's testimony in court, and how specific series allegations about CIA involvement had been, giving Webb's responses.[38]\n\nWhen the Los Angeles Times series appeared, Ceppos again wrote to defend the original series. He also defended the series in interviews with all three papers.[39] The extent of the criticism, however, convinced Ceppos that The Mercury News had to acknowledge to its readers that the series had been subjected to strong criticism.[40] He did this in a column that appeared on November 3, defending the seriesbut also committing the paper to a review of major criticisms.[41]\n\nCeppos' column drew editorial responses from both The New York Times and The Washington Post. An editorial in the Times, while criticizing the series for making \""unsubstantiated charges,\"" conceded that it did find \""drug-smuggling and dealing by Nicaraguans with at least tentative connections to the Contras\"" and called for further investigation.[42]\n\nThe Post response came from the paper's ombudsman, Geneva Overholser.[43] Overholser was harshly critical of the series, \""reported by a seemingly hotheaded fellow willing to have people leap to conclusions his reporting couldn't back up.\"" But while calling the flaws in the series \""unforgivably careless journalism,\"" Overholser also criticized the Post's refusal to print Ceppos' letter defending the series and sharply criticized the Post's coverage of the story. Calling the Post's overall focus \""misplaced\"", Overholser expressed regret that the paper had not taken the opportunity to re-examine whether the CIA had overlooked Contra involvement in drug smuggling, \""a subject The Post and the public had given short shrift.\""\n\nIn contrast, the series received support from Steve Weinberg, a former executive director of Investigative Reporters and Editors. In a long review of the series' claims in The Baltimore Sun, Weinberg said: \""I think the critics have been far too harsh. Despite some hyped phrasing, \""Dark Alliance\"" appears to be praiseworthy investigative reporting.\""[44]\n\nAfter the series' publication, the Northern California branch of the national Society of Professional Journalists had voted Webb \""Journalist of the Year\"" for 1996.[45] Despite the controversy that soon overtook the series, and the request of one board member to reconsider, the branch's board went ahead with the award in November.\n\nEnd of the series\n\nAfter Ceppos' column, The Mercury News spent the next several months conducting an internal review of the story. The review was conducted primarily by editor Jonathan Krim and reporter Pete Carey, who had written the paper's first published analysis of the series. Carey ultimately decided that there were problems with several parts of the story and wrote a draft article incorporating his findings.[46]\n\nThe paper also gave Webb permission to visit Central America again to get more evidence supporting the story.[47] By January, Webb filed drafts of four more articles based on his tripbut his editors concluded that the new articles would not help shore up the original series' claims.[48]\n\nThe editors met with Webb several times in February to discuss the results of the paper's internal review and eventually decided to print neither Carey's draft article nor the articles Webb had filed.[49] Webb was allowed to keep working on the story and made one more trip to Nicaragua in March. At the end of March, however, Ceppos told Webb that he was going to present the internal review findings in a column.[48] After discussions with Webb, the column was published on May 11, 1997.[50]\n\nIn the column, Ceppos continued to defend parts of the article, writing that the series had \""solidly documented\"" that the drug ring described in the series did have connections with the Contras and did sell large quantities of cocaine in inner-city Los Angeles.\n\nBut, Ceppos wrote, the series \""did not meet our standards\"" in four areas. 1) It presented only one interpretation of conflicting evidence and in one case \""did not include information that contradicted a central assertion of the series.\"" 2) The series' estimates of the money involved was presented as fact instead of an estimate. 3) The series oversimplified how the crack epidemic grew. 4) The series \""created impressions that were open to misinterpretation\"" through \""imprecise language and graphics.\""[51]\n\nCeppos noted that Webb did not agree with these conclusions. He concluded, \""How did these shortcomings occur? ... I believe that we fell short at every step of our process: in the writing, editing and production of our work. Several people here share that burden ... But ultimately, the responsibility was, and is, mine.\""\n\nResignation\n\nWebb strongly disagreed with Ceppos's column and in interviews, was harshly critical of the paper's handling of the story.[52] Editors at the paper, on the other hand, felt that Webb had failed to tell them about information that contradicted the series' claims and that he \""responded to concerns not with reasoned argumentbut with accusations of us selling him out.\""[53] In June 1997, The Mercury News told Webb it was transferring him from the paper's Sacramento bureau and offered him a choice between working at the main offices in San Jose under closer editorial supervision, or spot reporting in Cupertino; both locations were long commutes from his home in Sacramento.[53] Webb eventually chose Cupertinobut was unhappy with the routine stories he was reporting there and the long commute.[54] He resigned from the paper in November 1997.\n\nFederal investigation results\n\nThe reports of the three federal investigations into the claims of \""Dark Alliance\"" were not released until over a year after the series' publication. The reports rejected the series' main claims but were critical of some CIA and law enforcement actions.\n\nJustice Department report\n\nThe Department of Justice Inspector-General's report was released on July 23, 1998. According to the report's \""Epilogue,\"" the report was completed in December 1997 but was not released because the DEA was still attempting to use Danilo Blandón in an investigation of international drug dealers and was concerned that the report would affect the viability of the investigation. When Attorney General Janet Reno determined that a delay was no longer necessary, the report was released unchanged.[55]\n\nThe report covered actions by Department of Justice employees in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the DEA, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and U.S. Attorneys' Offices. It found that \""the allegations contained in the original Mercury News articles were exaggerations of the actual facts.\"" After examining the investigations and prosecutions of the main figures in the series, Blandón, Meneses and Ross, it concluded: \""Although the investigations suffered from various problems of communication and coordination, their successes and failures were determined by the normal dynamics that affect the success of scores of investigations of high-level drug traffickers … These factors, rather than anything as spectacular as a systematic effort by the CIA or any other intelligence agency to protect the drug trafficking activities of Contra supporters, determined what occurred in the cases we examined.\""[56]\n\nIt also concluded that \""the claims that Blandón and Meneses were responsible for introducing crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles and spreading the crack epidemic throughout the country were unsupported.\"" Although it did find that both men were major drug dealers, \""guilty of enriching themselves at the expense of countless drug users,\"" and that they had contributed money to the Contra cause, \""we did not find that their activities were responsible for the crack cocaine epidemic in South Central Los Angeles, much less the rise of crack throughout the nation, or that they were a significant source of support for the Contras.\"""",
