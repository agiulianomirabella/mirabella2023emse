It turns out it’ll be a fellow-inmate who gets a moment to talk to Shelia-and that inmate will be none other than Mike Guthrie (Ken Hanes). Of course, Mike has been Shelia’s partner in crime many times over the years. Since Shelia’s already getting antsy behind bars, it looks like she may push Mike to team up on an escaped plot. Mike might remind Shelia of all the trouble 👿 she’s already dragged him intobut he has a weak spot for her and always seems to cave in when she needs something. With that in mind, Mike may find himself roped into Shelia’s getaway plan since she’ll indeed work on one during May sweeps 🧹. In the meantime, Carter Walton will be deep in thought 💭 when Brooke Logan finds him at Forrester Creations. Brooke will sense that Carter’s ruminating on something, so he’ll admit he has some worries when it comes to Bill Spencer stealing back Katie Logan’s heart 💜. Carter may confess that he fears losing a future with Katiebut he’ll also hate the idea of Bill setting up Katie for more devastation. Since that’s always been the outcome in the past.

If I recall Ridge wanted to marry Brooke upon Caroline&#39;s departure but she had became pregnant by Eric. Taylor was dating Storm Brooke&#39;s brother when Brooke  gave birth to her first son Rick. Ridge started pursuing Taylor after she and Storm broke up with encouragement from his dear mother who had always been against Brooke at the time. .. Ridge married Taylor had Thomas and then the twins and then out of nowhere she disappeared behind amnesia. She married the prince from Morrocco and before Ridge and Brooke could once again bond with marriage she came back ..Ridge ended it with Brooke and he and Taylor reunited then had twins. Low and behold after Taylor and Brooke were shot and Taylor lying at her bedside in critical condition it was her former lover the prince from morrocco who came b ack kidnapping Taylor faking her death. Ridge had no choice but to move on so he got back with Brooke a woman whom he also loved. It&#39;s as simple as the nose on your  face. Time and tragedy  brings change for some folks.. After Taylor returned Stefanie laid a guilt trip on Ridge about family and children needing their father so he did what mommy wanted instead of following his heart that was with Brooke.

As far as when Brooke thought Ridge died in the oven fire behind Sheila&#39;s shenannigans .. Brooke was devasted and close to an emotional breakdown which is when Nick came to the rescue seducing her taking advantage of her vulnerabilty.

Following RJ’s return to Los Angeles, he’ll round up his family members and explain his vision for the future. RJ apparently settled on a career path while he was away in Europe. Now that RJ is done with school and ready to embrace the next steps, he’ll open up about his passion and what he wants to accomplish. It’s possible RJ will march to the best of his own drum 🥁 and want to do something outside of the box. RJ might rebel from his family’s fashion background and try to forge his own path. However, it makes more sense for RJ to end up working At Forrester Creations. Whether RJ wants to follow in Ridge’s footsteps as a designer or do something else for the company, it’ll be easier to include RJ in storylines if he works at the office with the others. This lined up with B&amp;B spoilers about Thomas Forrester and some worries he’ll develop thanks 😊 to RJ’s return. Thomas will fret over the family dynamics and how they’ll be affected with RJ back in the mix. Since RJ is the son of Ridge and Brooke Logan, he may hold a grudge over the fake CPS call and Thomas role in destroying “Bridge”. RJ might also grow concerned 😟 for Hope Logan now that she’s working with Thomas again. Of course having RJ home 🏠 will highlight how weird it is for Thomas and Hope to be attracted to each other when they share a younger brother. RJ blurs the Logan and Forrester lines, so Thomas and RJ could be gearing up for a rivalry-especially if RJ wants to design as well. Thomas is used to being a superstar at Forrester Creationsbut RJ might prove he’s got just as much talent or more.
