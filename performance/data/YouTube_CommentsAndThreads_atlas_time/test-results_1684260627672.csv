They didn&#39;t like the fact that a Southerner was the first president and so they threatened to leave but Adams convinced them to stay telling them that they would have their day soon and they did in 1796. MA also threatened to secede four times during the War of 1812 and effectively did so by not sending any troops to help in the war at all. MA and CT and DE met at the Hartford Conventions in the 1814-1815 winter to discuss seceding. When Jefferson was president one of his cabinet members asked him about the fact that MA kept threatening to secede and he said: &quot;If they deem it in their best interest to do so then by all means let them go&quot;. Hamilton convinced NY to go to the Ratifying conventions in the first place by telling them that &quot;the sword and the purse are inextricably linked&quot; and that because they are then NY could refuse to collect taxes for the Federal government because by doing that they would be sheathing the sword of tyranny. He even told them that if they signed onto the Constitution that they were not surrendering their sovereignty and that they could leave the union at any point if they wanted to. So when Hamilton told the NY delegates that they then went to the ratifying convention under that premise. They still demanded a guarantee from all of the Founding Fathers that they could leave if they wanted to. MA, NY, DE, VA, NC, and SC all demanded that guarantee from the Founding Fathers but DE and NC and SC dropped their demand when the Founding Fathers agreed to VA&#39;s demand because VA said that they were stating the right to leave on behalf of all other states. In fact, the VA state constitution, where the US Constitution gets the 2A from, literally says that the point in the population being able to arm themselves is so that the people of any state can have the ability to expel any military force that they deem contrary to the good of their state. That included Federal troops. That is also why Washington said that what he did with the Whiskey Rebellion was illegal and wrong and he pardoned everyone that had been arrested through it because he said it was illegal and wrong for the Federal authority to deploy troops in any state without the express permission of the governor of that state and he did not have permission from Governor Mifflin of PA to deploy troops in PA. Also, a union by definition is the coming together of free and independent entities to form a whole. That is why the Declaration of Independence defines us as &quot;a union of free and independent states that have the right that free and independent states aught to have including the right to wage war, conduct commerce, and negotiate treaties how they see fit&quot;.

In any case,.the human rights record of a Union General is not relevant to the discussion of why the Southern States Seceded.\n\n Lee inherited slaves from his father-in-law. They were his, not his wife's. And he freed his slaves because it was a provision in his father-in-law's will. He could have freed them earlier if he had cared tobut he didn't. In fact, he wasn't.shy about having slaves who attempted to escape whipped. I'm going to need a source for that bit about Lee educating his slaves. I could find no evidence of it. In fact,.it was.illegal to teach slaves to read.\n\nIf the plantation owners had used free wage labor instead of slaves,.they would have been simply \""Well off,\"".instead of \""Filthy Rich.\"" Of course, you can't expect someone to show a shred of human decency if it means giving up their private islands and Rolex collections. That would be unreasonable. Wait... It looks.like you went from downplaying the significance.of slavery to the war to sympathizing with the slave owners. That is a pretty big leap.\n\nThere was nothing unconstitutional about the U.S. invading the South. Sending armies to crush an armed rebellion is just about the most Constitutional thing that the government can ever do."",

Slavery however wasn&#39;t the only thing the South fought for they were fighting for their independence. This meant not only to preserve slavery but also because they didn&#39;t want to be under industry they didn&#39;t want to be under Northern politics they didn&#39;t want to be under Northern Society they didn&#39;t want anything to do with the north because they were under the perceived threat that the north was going to push all that they could on the south not just abolish the evil institution of slavery. The only good thing about secession I say is that slavery was abolished, other than that  secession was horrible secession was terrible it meant that America would not be seen  as a Beacon of Hope to those trying to find a new life a new opportunities  plus it hurt their Industries as well. The South trying to fight for their independence  so they didn&#39;t want to be under industry  was not mentioned in the  Declarations of secession only slavery was  because  of white supremacy and because it conomic Lee they primarily used slave labor to run their agricultural economy. Many Southerners who fought for the Confederacy agreed with the preservation of Union while many others did not.

              ""textOriginal"": ""Mark Hauser I agree with you about what you're saying it was about slavery. Slavery however wasn't the only thing the South fought for they were fighting for their independence. This meant not only to preserve slavery but also because they didn't want to be under industry they didn't want to be under Northern politics they didn't want to be under Northern Society they didn't want anything to do with the north because they were under the perceived threat that the north was going to push all that they could on the south not just abolish the evil institution of slavery. The only good thing about secession I say is that slavery was abolished, other than that  secession was horrible secession was terrible it meant that America would not be seen  as a Beacon of Hope to those trying to find a new life a new opportunities  plus it hurt their Industries as well. The South trying to fight for their independence  so they didn't want to be under industry  was not mentioned in the  Declarations of secession only slavery was  because  of white supremacy and because it conomic Lee they primarily used slave labor to run their agricultural economy. Many Southerners who fought for the Confederacy agreed with the preservation of Union while many others did not.

And there were 41,084 slave holders meaning that about 37% of the households were slave owners. And like those who don&#39;t own a home, still support the idea of home ownership and aspire to own a home in the future, so did the avg. southerner aspire to own a slave, not allbut certainly a majority.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e&quot;Although only one third of white families owned slaves, this was a remarkably widespread distribution of ownership.

Since on average about 1/3 of the families in the states that seceded were slave owners, so proportionally at least 1/3 of CSA soldiers came from slave owning families. And in the very beginning at least, the proportion was even higher as the planting class and slave holders mustered to protect their interests.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen we look at the Southern soldiers who owned slaves, the soldiers who lived with a family member who owned slaves, lived in households headed by non-family members who did; we see that nearly half of all Confederate soldiers in the early part of the war either lived with slaveholders or were slave owners themselves. The author of the particular research concludes his point: &quot;Nor did the direct exposure stop there. Untold numbers of enlistees rented land from, sold crops to, or worked for slaveholders. In the final tabulation, the vast majority of the volunteers of 1861 had a direct connection to slavery. For slaveholder and nonslaveholder alike, slavery lay at the heart of the Confederate nation. \u003cbr\u003eThe fact that their paper notes frequently depicted scenes of slaves demonstrated the institution&#39;s central role and symbolic value to the Confederacy.&quot; J.

In his book &quot;For Cause and Comrades&quot; James McPherson stresses the importance of slavery as one of the principal ideological considerations as to why men fought both North and South. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the South, McPherson has made the point that slavery was intrinsic to the concept of patriotism there.  And he makes the point that when considering the reasons the soldiers fought, the entire concept of patriotism itself in the South was tied to the idea of slavery. The notion was clearly that if slavery was destroyed, the South would lose its liberty and their families their safety by that one act alone. The two were inseparable, it was slavery that defined the South, so if slavery were destroyed, so would be southern liberty and the whites cast down to equality with the black slaves. McPherson found that slavery was such an accepted part of Southern life that the Southern soldiers references to it were often muted in terms like &#39;the southern way of life&#39; and &#39;Honor&#39; of the Southbut that the idea behind that &#39;way of life&#39; and &#39;honor&#39; was clearly the struggle to maintain slavery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou seem to fail to understand that slavery was more than an economic system, it was a system of labor, a social system, and a means of racial control. The Southern men went off to war to fight for the society they knew, the society that was defined by racial slavery and its attendant social system. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen southern soldiers say they are &quot;fighting for their way of life&quot;, it is the slavery that makes their way of life possible and without it there would be chaos and racial war in the South as they saw it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs just part of the examples he quoted this southern soldier:\u003cbr\u003e&quot;The vandals of the North... are determined to destroy slavery...we must all fight and I must fight and I choose to fight for Southern rights and Southern liberty&quot;\u003cbr\u003eAnd then he states:\u003cbr\u003e&quot;This paring of slavery and liberty as the twin goals for which the Confederates fought appeared in many volunteers letters.&quot; McPherson &quot;For Cause and Comrades&quot; P20\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr another glaring example can be made by looking at Sam Watkins whose memoirs were so prominent in Ken Burns series. The memoir and the series almost give the impression that Watkins is some plebeian with no direct connection to slavery.  However, census and tax records of antebellum Maury County show that Sam&#39;s father, Frederick, owned more than 100 slaves on two plantations in the county. The Watkins family was the third wealthiest in one of the most prosperous counties in the state. And Watkins was not unique for his unit. Nearly half of the company with which he left Maury County in 1861 came from slaveowning households. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey knew well that their &#39;way of life&#39; and &#39;honor&#39; were tied to slavery, it was just that, as typical Southerners, they usually referred to it with those previous sort of euphemisms. And even the non-slave holders were fighting to preserve that same racial order imposed by slavery that, as they understood it, they also benefited from. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you can also see it clearly in other pieces:\u003cbr\u003e&quot;If the policy of the Republicans is carried out, according to the programme indicated by the leaders of the party, and the South submits, degradation and ruin must overwhelm alike all classes of citizens in the Southern States. The slave-holder and non-¬slave-holder must ultimately share the same fate—all be degraded to a position of equality with free negroes, stand side by side with them at the polls, and fraternize in all the social relations of life; or else there will be an eternal war of races, desolating the land with blood, and utterly wasting and destroying all the resources of the country\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho can look upon such a picture without a shudder?
