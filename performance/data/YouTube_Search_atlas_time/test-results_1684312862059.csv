People thought it was too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn‚Äôt satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.\n\nHe imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer‚Äôs perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the groundbut since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. \n\nIn a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. \n\nEinstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference\n\nHe imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. \n\nHowever, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can‚Äôt be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. \n\nThis was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes onlybut it is really in 3D.  \n\nIn order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury‚Äôs orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. \n\nBut many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. \n#generalrelativity\n#einstein\nWhy is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. \n\nGeneral relativity does not answer everything. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn‚Äôt really tell us what exactly it is."",

        ""title"": ""Special Relativity simplified using no math. Einstein thought experiments"",
        ""description"": ""Einstein's Special Relativity Explained Simply - no math\n\nThis entire revolution in physics started with a simple thought experiments, in the prolific imagination before Einstein even graduated from high school.  Einstein‚Äôs theory of special relativity is convention today. But to understand how revolutionary it was for its time, it is helpful to look at what the conventional understanding of physics was during the time of Einstein‚Äôs teenage years.\n\nIn 1801, Thomas Young had conducted a simple double slit experiment that showed that light behaved like a wave. So the  theory about light at the time was that it was a wave.  The problem is that a wave, it was thought, had to move through some sort of medium. They called this substance the luminiferous aether.  \n\nBut in 1887, two scientists by the name of Albert Michelson and Edward Morely came up with an idea to test the existence of the aether. The background ether was believed to be unmoving and static, so if the wave was traveling in the same direction as the earth, the speed of the wave should be higher in the direction of the speed of the earth. Michelson and Morley showed that there was no difference in the speed of light of the two measurements. This seriously jeopardized the aether theory.  \n\nEinstein knew this, so he came up with a thought experiment as a 16 year old.  His thought was to imagine that he was chasing a beam of light while traveling at the speed of light himself.  What would he see? If young Albert could catch up to the beam, he should see a stationary wave.\n\nYet that was impossible. Einstein knew such stationary fields would violate the equations of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk Maxwell 20 years earlier. \n\nSo he came up with two postulates, and tried to figure out what the physics would be if the two postulates were true.\nPostulate 1 was that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial reference frames. \nPostulate 2 was that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all inertial reference frames.  \n\nThe first postulate had been assumed for hundreds of years. The second postulate, however, was the revolution. \n\nThis meant that young Einstein would never see the stationary, oscillating fields, because he could never catch the light beam.\nBut this solution seemed to have fatal flaw. Einstein later explained the problem with another thought experiment: \n\nImagine firing a light beam along a railroad embankment just as a train roars by in the same direction at, say, 2,000 miles a second. Someone standing on the embankment would measure the light beam‚Äôs speed to be the standard number, 186,000 miles a second. But someone on the train would see it moving past at only 184,000 miles a second. \n\nIf the speed of light was not constant, Maxwell‚Äôs equations would somehow have to look different inside the railcar, and the first postulate would be violated. The solution to his thought experiment was that observers in relative motion experience time differently. This completely overturned hundreds of years of classical physics in which time was absolute in the universe.  Einstein showed that time is relative, and varies in different frames of reference. The idea of the aether was no longer needed. \n   \nThis one realization that reality is not the same for different frames of reference also led to other implications of special relativity:\nThat Fast moving object appear shorter\nThat Fast moving objects appears to have increased mass \nAnd finally, the most famous equation in science E=MC2\nThat mass and energy are equivalent.\n\nSo, how did Einstein come up with his most famous equation based on his original two postulates? Let‚Äôs look at this conceptually.  \n\nIf conservation of mass is interpreted as conservation of rest mass, this did not hold true in special relativity. Since different observers would disagree about what the energy of a system was, the mass and energy taken together must be conserved, not just the mass on its own. \n\nIt turns out that for the laws of physics, namely conservation of energy and momentum, to be consistent in the two \""reference frames\"" of two observers moving with respect to each other, there has to be an energy associated with a body at rest, not just a body in motion. And that is what E=MC2 implies ‚Äì the M in the equation is the mass at rest.  \n\nSome people point out that much of the actual work for special relativity had already been done by the time Einstein presented it. The concepts of time dilation for moving objects, were already in place and the mathematics had already been developed by Lorentz & Poincare. Einstein still deserves the accolades because he rejected the idea of the ether all together which other scientists had not done, and the idea of mass and energy equivalence via E=MC2 is solely Einstein. Scientists who had done prior work like Thomson, Larmor, Lorentz, or Poincare had never implied such a bold proposition. \n\n#specialrelativity\n#einstein\n#michelsonmorley"",

People thought it was too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn‚Äôt satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.\n\nHe imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer‚Äôs perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the groundbut since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. \n\nIn a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. \n\nEinstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference\n\nHe imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. \n\nHowever, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can‚Äôt be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. \n\nThis was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes onlybut it is really in 3D.  \n\nIn order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury‚Äôs orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. \n\nBut many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. \n#generalrelativity\n#einstein\nWhy is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. \n\nGeneral relativity does not answer everything. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn‚Äôt really tell us what exactly it is."",

        ""title"": ""Special Relativity simplified using no math. Einstein thought experiments"",
        ""description"": ""Einstein's Special Relativity Explained Simply - no math\n\nThis entire revolution in physics started with a simple thought experiments, in the prolific imagination before Einstein even graduated from high school.  Einstein‚Äôs theory of special relativity is convention today. But to understand how revolutionary it was for its time, it is helpful to look at what the conventional understanding of physics was during the time of Einstein‚Äôs teenage years.\n\nIn 1801, Thomas Young had conducted a simple double slit experiment that showed that light behaved like a wave. So the  theory about light at the time was that it was a wave.  The problem is that a wave, it was thought, had to move through some sort of medium. They called this substance the luminiferous aether.  \n\nBut in 1887, two scientists by the name of Albert Michelson and Edward Morely came up with an idea to test the existence of the aether. The background ether was believed to be unmoving and static, so if the wave was traveling in the same direction as the earth, the speed of the wave should be higher in the direction of the speed of the earth. Michelson and Morley showed that there was no difference in the speed of light of the two measurements. This seriously jeopardized the aether theory.  \n\nEinstein knew this, so he came up with a thought experiment as a 16 year old.  His thought was to imagine that he was chasing a beam of light while traveling at the speed of light himself.  What would he see? If young Albert could catch up to the beam, he should see a stationary wave.\n\nYet that was impossible. Einstein knew such stationary fields would violate the equations of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk Maxwell 20 years earlier. \n\nSo he came up with two postulates, and tried to figure out what the physics would be if the two postulates were true.\nPostulate 1 was that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial reference frames. \nPostulate 2 was that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all inertial reference frames.  \n\nThe first postulate had been assumed for hundreds of years. The second postulate, however, was the revolution. \n\nThis meant that young Einstein would never see the stationary, oscillating fields, because he could never catch the light beam.\nBut this solution seemed to have fatal flaw. Einstein later explained the problem with another thought experiment: \n\nImagine firing a light beam along a railroad embankment just as a train roars by in the same direction at, say, 2,000 miles a second. Someone standing on the embankment would measure the light beam‚Äôs speed to be the standard number, 186,000 miles a second. But someone on the train would see it moving past at only 184,000 miles a second. \n\nIf the speed of light was not constant, Maxwell‚Äôs equations would somehow have to look different inside the railcar, and the first postulate would be violated. The solution to his thought experiment was that observers in relative motion experience time differently. This completely overturned hundreds of years of classical physics in which time was absolute in the universe.  Einstein showed that time is relative, and varies in different frames of reference. The idea of the aether was no longer needed. \n   \nThis one realization that reality is not the same for different frames of reference also led to other implications of special relativity:\nThat Fast moving object appear shorter\nThat Fast moving objects appears to have increased mass \nAnd finally, the most famous equation in science E=MC2\nThat mass and energy are equivalent.\n\nSo, how did Einstein come up with his most famous equation based on his original two postulates? Let‚Äôs look at this conceptually.  \n\nIf conservation of mass is interpreted as conservation of rest mass, this did not hold true in special relativity. Since different observers would disagree about what the energy of a system was, the mass and energy taken together must be conserved, not just the mass on its own. \n\nIt turns out that for the laws of physics, namely conservation of energy and momentum, to be consistent in the two \""reference frames\"" of two observers moving with respect to each other, there has to be an energy associated with a body at rest, not just a body in motion. And that is what E=MC2 implies ‚Äì the M in the equation is the mass at rest.  \n\nSome people point out that much of the actual work for special relativity had already been done by the time Einstein presented it. The concepts of time dilation for moving objects, were already in place and the mathematics had already been developed by Lorentz & Poincare. Einstein still deserves the accolades because he rejected the idea of the ether all together which other scientists had not done, and the idea of mass and energy equivalence via E=MC2 is solely Einstein. Scientists who had done prior work like Thomson, Larmor, Lorentz, or Poincare had never implied such a bold proposition. \n\n#specialrelativity\n#einstein\n#michelsonmorley"",

People thought it was too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn‚Äôt satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.\n\nHe imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer‚Äôs perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the groundbut since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. \n\nIn a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. \n\nEinstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference\n\nHe imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. \n\nHowever, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can‚Äôt be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. \n\nThis was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes onlybut it is really in 3D.  \n\nIn order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury‚Äôs orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. \n\nBut many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. \n#generalrelativity\n#einstein\nWhy is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. \n\nGeneral relativity does not answer everything. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn‚Äôt really tell us what exactly it is."",

        ""title"": ""Special Relativity simplified using no math. Einstein thought experiments"",
        ""description"": ""Einstein's Special Relativity Explained Simply - no math\n\nThis entire revolution in physics started with a simple thought experiments, in the prolific imagination before Einstein even graduated from high school.  Einstein‚Äôs theory of special relativity is convention today. But to understand how revolutionary it was for its time, it is helpful to look at what the conventional understanding of physics was during the time of Einstein‚Äôs teenage years.\n\nIn 1801, Thomas Young had conducted a simple double slit experiment that showed that light behaved like a wave. So the  theory about light at the time was that it was a wave.  The problem is that a wave, it was thought, had to move through some sort of medium. They called this substance the luminiferous aether.  \n\nBut in 1887, two scientists by the name of Albert Michelson and Edward Morely came up with an idea to test the existence of the aether. The background ether was believed to be unmoving and static, so if the wave was traveling in the same direction as the earth, the speed of the wave should be higher in the direction of the speed of the earth. Michelson and Morley showed that there was no difference in the speed of light of the two measurements. This seriously jeopardized the aether theory.  \n\nEinstein knew this, so he came up with a thought experiment as a 16 year old.  His thought was to imagine that he was chasing a beam of light while traveling at the speed of light himself.  What would he see? If young Albert could catch up to the beam, he should see a stationary wave.\n\nYet that was impossible. Einstein knew such stationary fields would violate the equations of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk Maxwell 20 years earlier. \n\nSo he came up with two postulates, and tried to figure out what the physics would be if the two postulates were true.\nPostulate 1 was that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial reference frames. \nPostulate 2 was that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all inertial reference frames.  \n\nThe first postulate had been assumed for hundreds of years. The second postulate, however, was the revolution. \n\nThis meant that young Einstein would never see the stationary, oscillating fields, because he could never catch the light beam.\nBut this solution seemed to have fatal flaw. Einstein later explained the problem with another thought experiment: \n\nImagine firing a light beam along a railroad embankment just as a train roars by in the same direction at, say, 2,000 miles a second. Someone standing on the embankment would measure the light beam‚Äôs speed to be the standard number, 186,000 miles a second. But someone on the train would see it moving past at only 184,000 miles a second. \n\nIf the speed of light was not constant, Maxwell‚Äôs equations would somehow have to look different inside the railcar, and the first postulate would be violated. The solution to his thought experiment was that observers in relative motion experience time differently. This completely overturned hundreds of years of classical physics in which time was absolute in the universe.  Einstein showed that time is relative, and varies in different frames of reference. The idea of the aether was no longer needed. \n   \nThis one realization that reality is not the same for different frames of reference also led to other implications of special relativity:\nThat Fast moving object appear shorter\nThat Fast moving objects appears to have increased mass \nAnd finally, the most famous equation in science E=MC2\nThat mass and energy are equivalent.\n\nSo, how did Einstein come up with his most famous equation based on his original two postulates? Let‚Äôs look at this conceptually.  \n\nIf conservation of mass is interpreted as conservation of rest mass, this did not hold true in special relativity. Since different observers would disagree about what the energy of a system was, the mass and energy taken together must be conserved, not just the mass on its own. \n\nIt turns out that for the laws of physics, namely conservation of energy and momentum, to be consistent in the two \""reference frames\"" of two observers moving with respect to each other, there has to be an energy associated with a body at rest, not just a body in motion. And that is what E=MC2 implies ‚Äì the M in the equation is the mass at rest.  \n\nSome people point out that much of the actual work for special relativity had already been done by the time Einstein presented it. The concepts of time dilation for moving objects, were already in place and the mathematics had already been developed by Lorentz & Poincare. Einstein still deserves the accolades because he rejected the idea of the ether all together which other scientists had not done, and the idea of mass and energy equivalence via E=MC2 is solely Einstein. Scientists who had done prior work like Thomson, Larmor, Lorentz, or Poincare had never implied such a bold proposition. \n\n#specialrelativity\n#einstein\n#michelsonmorley"",

        ""title"": ""What Exactly is Spacetime? Explained in Ridiculously Simple Words"",
        ""description"": ""Spacetime, as a concept, is related to a space that consists of 4 dimensions instead of the regular 3-dimensional space. As early as 1905, Einstein proposed a now widely popular theory that the speed of light is independent of the motion of all observers, and that space and time are interconnected in a single continuum. This theory, which is now a cornerstone of modern and quantum physics, is known as Einstein‚Äôs special theory of relativity. Einstein's proposed idea of a single continuum where space and time are interwoven is what people call ‚Äúspace-time‚Äù.\nAccording to this theory, time‚Äîwhich has traditionally been considered an independent entity according to the principles of classical physics‚Äîis affected when a body moves through space. This happens because, according to the theory, time and space are connected and part of a single continuum‚Äîspacetime.\nIn this video, we discuss spacetime in absolutely simple words: what exactly is spacetime and how is it related to the force of gravitation and Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity?\n\n#science #animation #spacetime\n\n\nReferences:\nhttps://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/blueshift/index.php/2015/11/25/100-years-of-general-relativity/\nhttps://sci.esa.int/web/lisa-pathfinder/-/56434-spacetime-curvature\nhttps://sites.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/teaching/HPS_0410/chapters/Special_relativity_rel_sim/index.html\n\n\nIf you wish to buy/license this video, please write to us at admin@scienceabc.com.\n\nVoice Over Artist: John Staughton ( https://www.fiverr.com/jswildwood )\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com"",

        ""description"": ""Is faster-than-light (FTL) travel possible? In most discussions of this, we get hung up on the physics of particular ideas, such as wormholes or warp drives. But today, we take a more zoomed out approach that addresses all FTL propulsion - as well as FTL messaging. Because it turns out that they all allow for time travel. Join us today as we explore why this is so and the profound consequences that ensue.\n\nWritten & presented by Prof David Kipping.

        ""title"": ""The Science of Extreme Time Dilation in Interstellar"",
        ""description"": ""For every one hour on Miller's planet, time elapses roughly 7 years on Earth. How is that possible? In this fun video, we'll explore the science behind #Time #Dilation.\n\nPart 2 of the Interstellar series: https://youtu.be/ML7mh_2_MUE\nPart 3 of the Interstellar series: https://youtu.be/JqKa6qyVYgg\n\nIf you'd like to see more of this kind of video, consider supporting our work by becoming a member today!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/BeeyondIdeas/join\n\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/beeyond.ideas/\n\n0:00 Introduction\n1:08 Recap of Einstein's relativity\n2:14 Gravitational redshift\n4:46 Time dilation in Interstellar\n6:27 One second on Miller's equals one day on Earth\n8:32 The problem with this extreme time dilation\n\nPS: Due to copyright restrictions, several music tracks used in this video had to be substituted with tracks from the YouTube audio library.  \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nScript:\n\nWe touch upon the fundamentals of this topic from our previous video, about Einstein‚Äôs relativity. You can check out the video herebut just to give you a brief summary, we can say the following.\nUnder the influence of a strong gravitational field, time slows down. So if you‚Äôre just hanging out near a massive object, you will experience the effect of time going slower.¬†¬†\n\nBut gravity isn‚Äôt the only thing that can warp time. According to another one of Einstein's theories, special relativity, time slows down for an object when it moves. Combining these two concepts together, we could consider this scenario.\n\nSuppose that we walk up a flight of stairs. Our body is slowly moved away from earth, meaning that we will experience time going faster. But at the same time, since we are not stationary while going up, we should experience time going slower. So being farther from the pull of Earth's gravity causes our clock to tick fasterbut moving ‚Äúcounteracts‚Äù this effect. Of course, this is all oversimplified.\n\nLet‚Äôs consider two comparable cases. We have person A, floating nearby a massive object with a lot of gravity. And person B, just casually floating in an empty void of space.¬†\nPerson A shines a green laser beam toward person B. Because light is a form of vibration, the laser beam has a color that corresponds to 600 trillion vib/s. Now light is also a form of energy, and as that beam of light comes out of that gravity of the massive object, it loses a lot of energy. This loss means that there‚Äôs a decrease in frequency.¬†\n\nSo, by the time that beam of light reaches person B, its frequency will have decreased by some factor. That means that instead of the green light, at six hundred trillion vibrations a sec, person B gets only.. let‚Äôs say 10 billion vib/s. Which is a microwave radio beam. This phenomenon is called the gravitational redshift.\n\nIndividual wiggles don't just go anywhere and disappear. Since person A creates 600 trillion wiggles every sec, while person B only gets 10 billion every second, the only way this can happen is if one second on one astronaut‚Äôs clock is not the same as one second on the other astronaut.\n\nIn other words, it only takes one sec for person A to create those 600 trillion wigglesbut it will take 60,000 seconds, or nearly a day, for person B to receive them. So this is what happens. Our clocks run at wildly different rates. And by \""clocks\"" I don't just mean mechanical or electronic devicesbut also biological clocks, like your heart, your lungs, your brain, etc.¬†\n\nPerson A takes a breath, takes another breath, and measures a few seconds between the two. For him, everything feels normal. Clocks tick the way they are supposed to. On the other hand person B, watching person A through a telescope, sees everything in slow motion, with several days passing between the two breaths.\n\nSo now revisiting this scene again from #Interstellar, you should get a better understanding as to why Cooper says he will be the same age as his daughter by the time he comes back from the mission.\n\nAccording to Einstein‚Äôs special relativity, the greater the acceleration of an object, the slower it will move through time. On Earth, where time is slowed by only a few microseconds per day, gravity‚Äôs pull is modest. And at the surface of a black hole, time is slowed to a halt, where the gravity is so humongous that nothing can escape.\n\nIn the movie, Miller‚Äôs planet is depicted to be present in the warped space, very close to a black hole Gargantua. Gravity‚Äôs pull on Miller‚Äôs planet is enormous. So if we apply Einstein‚Äôs relativity here, we would know that Miller‚Äôs planet would experience time at a very slow rate. But here on Earth, gravity is at a modest rate. And the gravitational force of the sun is also a billion times weaker than Gargantua. So people on Earth ‚Äúexperience time‚Äù faster than that of the three astronauts on Miller‚Äôs planet."",

These are three spatial dimensions and one time dimension in the universe. With these 4 coordinates, you could rendezvous with anyone anywhere in the universe. In fact these 4 dimensions can describe any event in the universe. \n  \nBut how did the idea of time as a dimension come about? How can we best visualize these 4 dimensions? And what really happens when space and time start doing seemingly weird things when two objects move relative to each other? \n\nIn the late 1800‚Äôs, scientists had recognized that there was an inconsistency between two theories ‚Äì Newton‚Äôs laws of motion, and Maxwell‚Äôs equations describing electricity and magnetism. The problem was the speed of light. \n\nMaxwell had shown that light was a self-propagating electromagnetic wave. And his theory predicted its speed to be about 300,000 km/s. \n\nThe question was what would the measured speed of light be if the person measuring it was moving. According to Newton, this moving observer should measure a different speed, than someone who was not moving. The measured speed should be the speed of the person, PLUS the speed of light. \n\nIn 1887, Michelson and Morley devised a highly sensitive experiment to measure the speed of light in the direction of motion of the earth. They found that the speed of light does not vary at all, due to the motion of the earth. A resolution of this unexpected result came from Albert Einstein who proposed that Newton‚Äôs laws of motion needed to be modified. He determined that the speed of light does not change in any reference frame, and worked out the implications of this idea. \n\nEinstein showed that observers moving at different speeds will disagree about distance and time between two events. In other words, they will experience space and time differently. \n\nHermann Minkowski realized that relativity is really a theory about the geometrical relationship between space and time, and coined the term \""spacetime.\"" He suggested an easier way to visualize these four dimensions - by eliminating one of the dimensions, and making the vertical axis timebut in terms of length.\n\nSomething not moving spatially would be depicted as a vertical line. This is called called this a world line for the particle. \n\nA uniformly moving point would be depicted as a diagonal line on this graph because it would be moving in at least one of the spatial coordinates as it is moving forward in time. An accelerating particle would be a curved line. A light flash somewhere in this 2D space would spread in all directions with time. This forms the shape of a cone. So Minkowski called this a light cone. \n\nA light cone represents all the future events in spacetime that the light reaches from its initial event A. An upside down cone is the past light cone, and represents all the past events in spacetime that reach Event A.\n\nEvent A can be you here and now. The points outside these two light cones are causally disconnected from event A, meaning they cannot reach or be reached by event A. \n\nHow does special relativity enter affect world lines and light cones. Two observers moving relative to each other will not agree on simultaneity. Each will perceive the other's light cone as being tilted such that their observations being different can be explained. \n#minkowskispacetime\n#lightcones\n#worldlines \nWhat this shows is that simultaneity is relative to the observer. There is no absolute simultaneity in the universe. But each observer sees and experiences exactly the same spacetime. And both will agree on causality. Causality is always preserved in a universe with a finite speed of light. I will have more details on this issue of causality in a future video."",

        ""title"": ""What If You Could Access the FOURTH Dimension? Interstellar explained"",
        ""description"": ""What exactly is a tesseract? How could such a hyper-cubic, grid-like chamber become a time machine? In this video, we'll explore the science behind #Interstellar #tesseract \n\nPart 3 of the Interstellar series: https://youtu.be/DwJNToteZOw\n\nIf you'd like to see more of this kind of video, consider supporting our work by becoming a member today!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/BeeyondIdeas/join\n\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/beeyond.ideas/\n\nTimecode:\n0:00 Teaser\n0:53 Entering a black hole\n1:57 Accessing the fourth dimension\n4:49 The \""hidden\"" layer\n6:43 Backward-in-time gravitational force\n8:01 Interstellar's plot: a paradox\n\n***\n\nScript:\n\nThe initial question to ask here is how Cooper got into the tesseract in the first place. From the film, we know that it is because he intends to lighten the Endurance‚Äôs load so that Dr. Brand can reach Edmunds‚Äô planet. So he flings himself and goes directly into the blackhole Gargantua.\n\nBut you might be asking: how could you enter a black hole and emerge alive at the other end? You may have heard that when someone are pulled into into a blackhole, their bodies could be stretched to the size of a spaghetti strand. In addition, if you approach the blackhole on a normal, perpedicular trajectory, your body will split into 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.\n\nHowever, because the film indicates that this is a spinning blackhole, this phenomenon does not occur. And in principle, you should be able to escape the bifurcation of your body by following a specific trajectory.\n\nNow.. as we are falling towards a black hole, time for us is gonna flow more slowly than the rest of the universe. And once Cooper is inside, time will stop flowing for him, according to an outside observer. When Cooper gets to a chamber, he realizes that this 4 dimensional hypercube is in fact, a manifestation of Murph‚Äôs actual bedroom at a particular moment of time.\n\n----\n\nFirst and foremost, we must state the obvious. Interstellar's science encompasses all four areas of physics: Newtonian, relativistic, quantum, and quantum gravity. In our current understanding of quantum gravity, our universe is a membrane, or as physicst would like to call it, a brane. This is the place where you, I, and everything else that exists or have existed, lay.\n\nThis brane resides in \""hyperspace,\"" which is a higher-dimensional space. And at this point in time, this notion falls within the educated guesses. This is what the warped brane would look like if viewed from a hyperspace.\n\nIn reality, black holes are formed of warped space and warped time, which are made of components from the same brane that we are familiar with. As a result, the idea that the singularity leads to a portal, which would then enable access to hyperspace, is purely speculative.\n\nBut we're not done yet. Let's pretend that may happen, for the sake of the movie. Through this blackhole, Cooper escapes our universe brane and use it as a bridge into hyperspace. Essentially, allowing him to enter the tesseract, a chamber that extends from the singularity of the blackhole into hyperspace.\n\nFirst of all, the back face of the tesseract corresponds with Murphy‚Äôs bedroom. So everything in her bedroom, including herself, is somehow inside the tesseract‚Äôs back face. And one particular moment in time could be observed in six different viewing angles. It might come from above, while also on the right side simultaneously.\n\nThe second thing, we see that the bedroom has extrusions all around the tesseract, with two directions transverse to Cooper's chamber. Cross sections through the room that are vertical, travel upward with the passage of time. With the same notion, the cross sections that are horizontal, travel rightward as time passes. Essentially this cross section depicts a different viewing angle of Murph‚Äôs bedroom. Where the two extrusions intersect, there is a moment in the bedroom that you could observe its current ‚Äúpresent‚Äù. An actual moment of time. This is where the movie defines it as ‚Äúwhile extrusions are extending, time is flowing along them‚Äù. \n\nCooper has the ability to travel faster than the flow of time in the extrusions, allowing him to explore the tesseract complex. In summary, this weird psychedelic vortex was merely our normal spacetimebut with one temporal dimension, or time, manifested as an acessible spatial dimension. In this chamber, Cooper could simply go forward and backward in time, as simple as moving diagonally up and down through the tesseract complex. #TimeTravel"",

People thought it was too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn‚Äôt satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.\n\nHe imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer‚Äôs perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the groundbut since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. \n\nIn a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. \n\nEinstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference\n\nHe imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. \n\nHowever, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can‚Äôt be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. \n\nThis was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes onlybut it is really in 3D.  \n\nIn order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury‚Äôs orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. \n\nBut many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. \n#generalrelativity\n#einstein\nWhy is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. \n\nGeneral relativity does not answer everything. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn‚Äôt really tell us what exactly it is."",

        ""title"": ""Special Relativity simplified using no math. Einstein thought experiments"",
        ""description"": ""Einstein's Special Relativity Explained Simply - no math\n\nThis entire revolution in physics started with a simple thought experiments, in the prolific imagination before Einstein even graduated from high school.  Einstein‚Äôs theory of special relativity is convention today. But to understand how revolutionary it was for its time, it is helpful to look at what the conventional understanding of physics was during the time of Einstein‚Äôs teenage years.\n\nIn 1801, Thomas Young had conducted a simple double slit experiment that showed that light behaved like a wave. So the  theory about light at the time was that it was a wave.  The problem is that a wave, it was thought, had to move through some sort of medium. They called this substance the luminiferous aether.  \n\nBut in 1887, two scientists by the name of Albert Michelson and Edward Morely came up with an idea to test the existence of the aether. The background ether was believed to be unmoving and static, so if the wave was traveling in the same direction as the earth, the speed of the wave should be higher in the direction of the speed of the earth. Michelson and Morley showed that there was no difference in the speed of light of the two measurements. This seriously jeopardized the aether theory.  \n\nEinstein knew this, so he came up with a thought experiment as a 16 year old.  His thought was to imagine that he was chasing a beam of light while traveling at the speed of light himself.  What would he see? If young Albert could catch up to the beam, he should see a stationary wave.\n\nYet that was impossible. Einstein knew such stationary fields would violate the equations of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk Maxwell 20 years earlier. \n\nSo he came up with two postulates, and tried to figure out what the physics would be if the two postulates were true.\nPostulate 1 was that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial reference frames. \nPostulate 2 was that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all inertial reference frames.  \n\nThe first postulate had been assumed for hundreds of years. The second postulate, however, was the revolution. \n\nThis meant that young Einstein would never see the stationary, oscillating fields, because he could never catch the light beam.\nBut this solution seemed to have fatal flaw. Einstein later explained the problem with another thought experiment: \n\nImagine firing a light beam along a railroad embankment just as a train roars by in the same direction at, say, 2,000 miles a second. Someone standing on the embankment would measure the light beam‚Äôs speed to be the standard number, 186,000 miles a second. But someone on the train would see it moving past at only 184,000 miles a second. \n\nIf the speed of light was not constant, Maxwell‚Äôs equations would somehow have to look different inside the railcar, and the first postulate would be violated. The solution to his thought experiment was that observers in relative motion experience time differently. This completely overturned hundreds of years of classical physics in which time was absolute in the universe.  Einstein showed that time is relative, and varies in different frames of reference. The idea of the aether was no longer needed. \n   \nThis one realization that reality is not the same for different frames of reference also led to other implications of special relativity:\nThat Fast moving object appear shorter\nThat Fast moving objects appears to have increased mass \nAnd finally, the most famous equation in science E=MC2\nThat mass and energy are equivalent.\n\nSo, how did Einstein come up with his most famous equation based on his original two postulates? Let‚Äôs look at this conceptually.  \n\nIf conservation of mass is interpreted as conservation of rest mass, this did not hold true in special relativity. Since different observers would disagree about what the energy of a system was, the mass and energy taken together must be conserved, not just the mass on its own. \n\nIt turns out that for the laws of physics, namely conservation of energy and momentum, to be consistent in the two \""reference frames\"" of two observers moving with respect to each other, there has to be an energy associated with a body at rest, not just a body in motion. And that is what E=MC2 implies ‚Äì the M in the equation is the mass at rest.  \n\nSome people point out that much of the actual work for special relativity had already been done by the time Einstein presented it. The concepts of time dilation for moving objects, were already in place and the mathematics had already been developed by Lorentz & Poincare. Einstein still deserves the accolades because he rejected the idea of the ether all together which other scientists had not done, and the idea of mass and energy equivalence via E=MC2 is solely Einstein. Scientists who had done prior work like Thomson, Larmor, Lorentz, or Poincare had never implied such a bold proposition. \n\n#specialrelativity\n#einstein\n#michelsonmorley"",

People thought it was too weird and radical to be real. Einstein wasn‚Äôt satisfied with his theory either, because the theory did not apply if Gravity was present or if the observer was accelerating. One day, while observing a window washer on a ladder near his patent office, he had a thought experiments.\n\nHe imagined what would happen if the worker were to fall. He put himself in the window washer‚Äôs perspective, and imagined  what he would experience as he was falling. He realized that if he was falling, gravity would be the only force acting on him. He would be accelerating towards the groundbut since the ground would not be pushing up on his body, he would feel no weight. And this would be no different than being weightless in space. \n\nIn a way gravity and acceleration were different ways to describe the same thing. The way to connect gravity in the theory of relativity was through the idea of acceleration, and this became the basis of general relativity. \n\nEinstein imagined being in a room with no windows, and a bathroom scale. It would weigh 80 Kgs, What if the room was  on a space ship accelerating in an upward direction at 9.8 m/s/s. He would feel the same weight. There would be no difference\n\nHe imagined what would happen if he took a flashlight and pointed it from one side of the room to the other, as the space ship was accelerating upwards. If he had a ruler, he could measure the height of the light on the other side of the room. He realized that the height measured on the wall would be lower than the source of the light, because the floor of the room would be rushing upwards at ever faster speeds, as the light was propagating across the room. The light beam would appear to curve downward. \n\nHowever, If you were on earth, and you measured the two heights, you may think that there should be no difference. That light should go straight to the other side of the room. Einstein thought it can‚Äôt be because it would violate the principle of equivalence. Acceleration of the room on a space should be no different than the room under the influence of gravity on earth. He realized that this meant light must bend in the presence of a gravitational field.\n\nBut light should be going on the shortest path. Then he realized, maybe the shortest path between two points is not a straight line but a curved line near gravity. \n\nThis was the key insight that Einstein had about gravity. But in order to express this mathematically, it required very complicated mathematics that even a genius like Einstein could not easily figure out. He contacted an old buddy from his college days, mathematician Marcel Grossman.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that the trampoline analogy you normally see on TV shows and youtube videos like this is a 2D plane used for visualization purposes onlybut it is really in 3D.  \n\nIn order for this theory to really be taken seriously, it had to make a prediction that could be tested, which was confirmed by the fact that it explained Mercury‚Äôs orbit which had been a mystery for decades because it had a precession. General relativity predicted exactly the precession that Mercury actually has. \n\nBut many skeptics still remained. The most fool proof confirmation  came 4 years after he published it,when a team led English Astronomer, Arthur Eddington. in 1919, photographed stars near the sun during a total solar eclipse. He found that light passed near the sun was bent by the curvature of space due to its gravity.  This is the moment Einstein became a celebrity. \n#generalrelativity\n#einstein\nWhy is this not just a distortion of space but also of time?...because special relativity says that light always moves at the same speed regardless of perspective or reference frame.  This means that light will have the same speed in an accelerating reference frame as it will in a resting reference frame.  But since the distance traveled by the beam of light in a gravitational field is longer due the curving of space, in order for the speed of light to remain constant, time itself must pass slower in the gravitational field relative to time in empty space. \n\nGeneral relativity does not answer everything. Although it tells us how gravity works, it doesn‚Äôt really tell us what exactly it is."",

        ""title"": ""Special Relativity simplified using no math. Einstein thought experiments"",
        ""description"": ""Einstein's Special Relativity Explained Simply - no math\n\nThis entire revolution in physics started with a simple thought experiments, in the prolific imagination before Einstein even graduated from high school.  Einstein‚Äôs theory of special relativity is convention today. But to understand how revolutionary it was for its time, it is helpful to look at what the conventional understanding of physics was during the time of Einstein‚Äôs teenage years.\n\nIn 1801, Thomas Young had conducted a simple double slit experiment that showed that light behaved like a wave. So the  theory about light at the time was that it was a wave.  The problem is that a wave, it was thought, had to move through some sort of medium. They called this substance the luminiferous aether.  \n\nBut in 1887, two scientists by the name of Albert Michelson and Edward Morely came up with an idea to test the existence of the aether. The background ether was believed to be unmoving and static, so if the wave was traveling in the same direction as the earth, the speed of the wave should be higher in the direction of the speed of the earth. Michelson and Morley showed that there was no difference in the speed of light of the two measurements. This seriously jeopardized the aether theory.  \n\nEinstein knew this, so he came up with a thought experiment as a 16 year old.  His thought was to imagine that he was chasing a beam of light while traveling at the speed of light himself.  What would he see? If young Albert could catch up to the beam, he should see a stationary wave.\n\nYet that was impossible. Einstein knew such stationary fields would violate the equations of electromagnetism developed by James Clerk Maxwell 20 years earlier. \n\nSo he came up with two postulates, and tried to figure out what the physics would be if the two postulates were true.\nPostulate 1 was that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial reference frames. \nPostulate 2 was that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all inertial reference frames.  \n\nThe first postulate had been assumed for hundreds of years. The second postulate, however, was the revolution. \n\nThis meant that young Einstein would never see the stationary, oscillating fields, because he could never catch the light beam.\nBut this solution seemed to have fatal flaw. Einstein later explained the problem with another thought experiment: \n\nImagine firing a light beam along a railroad embankment just as a train roars by in the same direction at, say, 2,000 miles a second. Someone standing on the embankment would measure the light beam‚Äôs speed to be the standard number, 186,000 miles a second. But someone on the train would see it moving past at only 184,000 miles a second. \n\nIf the speed of light was not constant, Maxwell‚Äôs equations would somehow have to look different inside the railcar, and the first postulate would be violated. The solution to his thought experiment was that observers in relative motion experience time differently. This completely overturned hundreds of years of classical physics in which time was absolute in the universe.  Einstein showed that time is relative, and varies in different frames of reference. The idea of the aether was no longer needed. \n   \nThis one realization that reality is not the same for different frames of reference also led to other implications of special relativity:\nThat Fast moving object appear shorter\nThat Fast moving objects appears to have increased mass \nAnd finally, the most famous equation in science E=MC2\nThat mass and energy are equivalent.\n\nSo, how did Einstein come up with his most famous equation based on his original two postulates? Let‚Äôs look at this conceptually.  \n\nIf conservation of mass is interpreted as conservation of rest mass, this did not hold true in special relativity. Since different observers would disagree about what the energy of a system was, the mass and energy taken together must be conserved, not just the mass on its own. \n\nIt turns out that for the laws of physics, namely conservation of energy and momentum, to be consistent in the two \""reference frames\"" of two observers moving with respect to each other, there has to be an energy associated with a body at rest, not just a body in motion. And that is what E=MC2 implies ‚Äì the M in the equation is the mass at rest.  \n\nSome people point out that much of the actual work for special relativity had already been done by the time Einstein presented it. The concepts of time dilation for moving objects, were already in place and the mathematics had already been developed by Lorentz & Poincare. Einstein still deserves the accolades because he rejected the idea of the ether all together which other scientists had not done, and the idea of mass and energy equivalence via E=MC2 is solely Einstein. Scientists who had done prior work like Thomson, Larmor, Lorentz, or Poincare had never implied such a bold proposition. \n\n#specialrelativity\n#einstein\n#michelsonmorley"",
